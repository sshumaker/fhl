## Company-directed Learning Opportunities

The Growth and Development policy is meant to further team members' learning and growth. Company-directed learning opportunities, such as mandatory conferences or training that are required to fulfill their job duties, are not within the scope of the Growth and Development policy and should be budgeted for outside the policy. Such expenses will not be deducted from the team member's annual Growth and Development limit and should be paid for by GitLab rather than reimbursed to the team member.

## How to Apply For Growth and Development Benefits

**Step 1:** Have a [career development conversation](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#what-is-career-development) with your manager to discuss the learning opportunity. It's important to discuss timing, team member capacity, and application timeline for both the program and benefit processing. This conversation should allow time for you to apply for program/benefit and your manager to ensure team budget capacity.

**Step 2:** Create a new Growth & Development issue using one of the issue templates below. Please create your issue within the notification timeframe set out below.

### Tax Implications

In some countries, the Growth and Development Benefit may be considered as taxable income and can be (partially) exempted from personal income taxes or subject to employer withholding taxes. Check [the tax table](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/tax/) for any tax implications in your country.

For example, in the United States 2021 tax year, if GitLab pays over [$5,250 for educational benefits for you during the year, you must generally pay tax on the amount over $5,250](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-benefits-for-education-information-center). GitLab should include in your wages (Form W-2, box 1) the amount over $5,250 in income.
