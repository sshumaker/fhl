### GitLab Parental Leave Payments and Employment Insurance

The Employment Insurance benefit and Quebec Parental Insurance plan provides government financial assistance to parents who are away from work to care for their newborn or newly adopted child or if they are pregnant or have recently given birth.

The combined amount of Employment Insurance payments and supplementary payments from GitLab cannot exceed a team member's normal weekly earnings. The supplementary payment will not be used to reduce other statutory accumulated benefits such as sick leave, vacation leave or severance pay.

Per the statutory requirements in Canada, a team member is ineligible to receive any Employment Insurance payments if they are receiving full parental leave pay from GitLab.

**It is important to be aware that the eligibility requirements for Employment Insurance benefits and eligibility to take a job-protected leave in your province may be different. For more information on Employment Insurance, contact [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental.html) or [Government of Quebec](https://www.rqap.gouv.qc.ca/en/what-is-the-quebec-parental-insurance-plan)**

## Other Leave Types

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Ontario</summary>

The following statutory leave types run concurrently with GitLab PTO. Each leave is separate, and the right to each leave is independent of any right a team member may have to other leave(s). A team member may be entitled to more than one leave for the same event. A team member’s entitlement to any statutory leaves of absence is governed by the legislation applicable in the province in which the employee works for the Company. Statutory leaves of absence will be tracked separately. Any additional paid or unpaid leaves provided by GitLab, are inclusive of, and not in addition to, any concurrent paid or unpaid leaves provided by the applicable employment standards legislation. Additional information can be found on the [Government of Ontario website](https://www.ontario.ca/document/your-guide-employment-standards-act-0). Statutory leave for which team members are not entitled to pay will be paid at 100% of the team member’s salary for the first 25 days. If the team member is eligible for a government benefit, GitLab will supplement the payment so that the team member receives 100% of their salary for the first 25 days. 

To initiate leave, and ensure that statutory entitlements are properly tracked, team members should contact `leaves@gitlab.com` and then submit the time off request by selecting the appropriate option in PTO by Deel. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your time away in PTO by Deel, the Absence Management team can enter your time off in BambooHR on your behalf.
