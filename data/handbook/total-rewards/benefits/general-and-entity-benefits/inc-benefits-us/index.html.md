## Specific to US based team members
 
US based benefits are arranged through Willis Towers Watson and managed on the PlanSource platform. The benefits decision discussions are held by Total Rewards, the CFO, and the CEO to elect the next year's benefits by the carrier's deadlines. Total Rewards will notify the team of open enrollment as soon as details become available. 
 
## 2023 Plan Year 

For the 2023 plan year GitLab will continue to cover 100% of team member coverage and will increase the employer contribution portion for dependent medical coverage from 66% to 71% for all medical plans with dependent coverage.

### Open Enrollment

GitLab’s US Benefits Open Enrollment for Calendar Year 2023 will take place from 2022-10-31 through 2022-11-11. This year will be a passive enrollment, which means that if you do not wish to make changes to your health benefits (medical, dental and vision), you do not have to re-enroll for 2023; your 2022 elections will automatically roll over, with the exception of Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), which you must actively (re)enroll in every year. We are staying with our current carriers (Cigna, Kaiser, etc).

Please take note of the updated premium rates for the Cigna and Kaiser plans listed in the [2023 US Benefits Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vwdEJIdqogqbfFpwcRVC1cHcjH4SsckR/view?usp=sharing). 

## 2022 Plan Year

For the 2022 Plan year GitLab covers **100% of team member contributions and 66% for spouse, dependents, and/or domestic partner** of premiums for medical, dental, and vision coverage. Plan rates are locked through December 31, 2022.

## Enrolling in Benefits
 
If you have existing coverage when joining GitLab (e.g. coverage for an additional month from your prior employer), you have the option of enrolling in GitLab's coverage after your prior coverage terminates. If you wish to do this, you should register with PlanSource during onboarding and waive all coverages. Once your previous coverage is terminated, you should sign up for coverage through PlanSource on or within 30 days of the termination date by initiating a Qualifying Life Event and providing proof of coverage termination.
 
 **If you do not enroll in a plan within your benefits election period, you will automatically be enrolled in the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).**
 
More information on the processed deductions in payroll from PlanSource can be found on the [Accounting and Reporting page](/handbook/finance/accounting/).

For questions on benefits, please see the following [PlanSource Video Library](https://videolibrary.plansource.com/).

This also applies to enrolling in either your own supplemental life insurance or supplemental spouse/dependent life insurance through your dependent who is employed by GitLab, but not both.
 
#### Qualifying Life Events
 
Due to IRS guidelines, you cannot make changes to your health insurance benefits outside of GitLab's annual open enrollment period unless you experience a [Qualifying Life Event](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/).
 
A QLE is a change in your situation — like getting married, having a baby, etc that can make you eligible for a special enrollment period. You have ***30 days from the date of your qualifying event*** to submit your requested change to PlanSource.

## Group Medical Coverage
 
GitLab offers plans from Cigna, as well as additional Kaiser options for residents of California, and Colorado. Hawaii residents are offered Kaiser options for medical plan enrollment. 
 
If you already have current group medical coverage, **you may choose to waive or opt out of group health benefits. If you choose to waive health coverage, you will receive a $300.00 monthly benefit allowance** and will still be able to enroll in dental, vision, optional plans, and flexible spending accounts. In order to receive the monthly benefit allowance you must log on to PlanSource and actively waive medical cover. 
 
If you do not enroll in a plan within your benefits election period, you will automatically be enrolled in the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).
 
GitLab has confirmed that our medical plans are CREDITABLE. Please see the attached [2021 notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_w2svtOAP09lVKLWXsKzyLhZdlmB2ElZ/view?usp=sharing) and page 7 of the [2022 Annual Notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Um-mVPUiub7HPLBf6wtkRoY1tMleDuQq/view?usp=sharing).

##### Cigna Transgender Benefit Coverage
 
Cigna has advised they will provide [WPATH](https://www.wpath.org/) compliant coverage for all plans. For more information on their coverage, please see the [coverage policy document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdsiFcTFEWsIidOXwPBcNNOCqFVERSXg/view?usp=sharing). For Cigna to provide coverage, medical necessity must be proven. It is highly recommended to go through the prior authorization process when seeking treatment.
 
Please reach out to the [Total Rewards team and WTW](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#who-to-contact) with any questions or if you need help while seeking authorization for a treatment. 
 
##### Cigna Provider Search
 
1. Visit [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest). If you haven't previously registered for an account, you will want to register.
1. Select "Find Care & Costs" at the top of the page.
1. Here you can select to search by Doctor Type, Name, Reason for Visit, Facility, or you can price a medication at local pharmacies.
1. When you scroll down, there are quick links for your nearest urgent care and telehealth.

Potential joiners who do not have a myCigna account yet can search for providers on the [Cigna Website](https://hcpdirectory.cigna.com/web/public/consumer/directory/plan-selection). When selecting a plan everyone at GitLab (PPO, EPO, and HDHP members) will use the OPEN ACCESS PLUS selection, except for Utah members, who will use the PPO option. 

Team Members and potential joiners can also reach out to the [Cigna One Guide service](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIvtYtYPSt3Q0h-Byd16CFFfT0bxv8yF/view?usp=sharing) to check if their doctors are in-network and walk through the GitLab plans with a Cigna rep.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
 
As an additional measure to confirm “Contracted Providers” (i.e. In-Network), it’s always a good idea to follow up with Providers directly (phone, email or otherwise) to additionally confirm if a Provider is contracted with Cigna or not and if the type of service is covered. In some instances, the same provider may be covered In-Network for certain types of services, but may be Out-Network for other services.
Provider contracts change and sometimes the contracts change faster than the website maintenance teams for the insurance carriers. It's better to spend time researching and confirming rather than assuming and being stuck with *balance billing* from Out of Network providers. 
*Balance billing* is if the Out of Network provider's charge is $100 and the carrier’s maximum allowed reimbursement (MAR) amount is $70, the provider is within rights to bill you for the remaining $30. A “Cigna Contracted Provider” cannot balance bill Cigna members.

### Group Long-Term and Short-Term Disability Insurance
 
GitLab provides, at no cost to our Inc and Federal team members, a disability policy through NY Life that may replace up to 66.7% of your base salary, for qualifying disabilities. For short-term disability there is a weekly maximum benefit of $2,500; for long-term disability, there is a monthly benefit maximum of $12,500.

Short-term disability insurance has a 7-calendar day waiting period before payments begin. Benefits coverage (medical, dental, vision, etc.) and vesting will continue for the time the team member is receiving short-term disability pay. 

**GitLab Process for Disability Claim**
 
1. Team Members unable to work due to disability, as defined by the applicable short-term disability plan, should contact the Absence Management team (leaves@gitlab.com) as soon as possible.  See [Sick Time reporting proceedures in the US](/handbook/paid-time-off/#sick-time-procedures---usa).  
1. The Absence Management team will complete the Employer portion of the the [Short-Term disability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) application and email the completed portion along with the [Assignment of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nd0r5qj9PS21HDFH97Jbft9dZzlpTOsr/view?usp=sharing) form. 
1. At the end of the maximum benefit period for short-term disability of 12 weeks, the team member will determine whether they are able to return back to work.
   * If the team member intends to return on or before the end of the 12 weeks, they should email leaves@gitlab.com a Return to Work authorization form from their physician stating that they are able to return to work and listing any accommodations needed, if applicable, at least 5 calendar days before their return date. The Absence Management team will request this at least 5 business days before the team member's anticipated return to work date if not already provided by the team member.
   * If the team member is unable to return, the team member will be moved to unpaid leave and will have the option to continue their benefits by electing [COBRA coverage](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-consumer.pdf). The team member will be eligible to apply for long-term disability at this time.
 
**Short-Term Disability Claim Process via NYLife**
 
1. Team member will submit the Claimant portion of the [Short-Term Disability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guydUTEc0vBFMaa_IsSktZ5hXAbOXdvD/view?usp=sharing) application and remit to their physician to complete the rest. 
     - The completed application can be sent directly to NYLife (using the mail or fax number at the top of the form) or can be returned to the Absence Management team and will be submitted on the team member's behalf. 
     - This is completely at the preference of the team member or the requirement from the doctor, but the team member should confirm the choice with the Absence Management team.
2. If the team member opts to send the form directly to NYLife, the Absence Management team will email the completed employer portion of the Short-Term Disability form to NYLife via email: `dallasfco.intake2@cigna.com`and `TeamArakeliansMailbox@Cigna.com`.
3. NYLife Claims Process:  
     - Within 3 business days of NYLife receiving the claim, their claims team will contact the team member to gather additional medical or eligibility data, if needed. 
     - The claims team will also contact the Absence Management team to confirm eligibility and verify job responsibilities, if needed. 
     - The NYLife claims team will immediately begin reviewing the information available to make a decision. NYLife may also contact the team member's physician (if needed) once NYLife has the team members authorization to do so. 
     - If the claim is denied, the team member will receive a call from NYLife explaining the decision. The Absence Management team will also receive a notification of the denial and process any pay owed to the team member.
     - If approved, communication is sent to the Absence Management team and claim status reports with approval date and estimated return-to-work date is provided.  
5. The Absence Management team will process the approval or denial and file all related paperwork in BambooHR. 
 
## Employee Assistance Program

More information can be found online on [myCigna](https://my.cigna.com/web/public/guest) for the following topics: Emotional Health and Family Support, Home Life Referrals, Financial and Legal Assistance, Job and Career Support, and other topics.

The company offers a 401k plan in which you may make voluntary pre-tax contributions toward your retirement.
 
### Administrative Details of 401k Plan
 
1. You are eligible to participate in GitLab’s 401k as of your hire date. There is no auto-enrollment. You must actively elect your deductions.
1. You will receive an invitation to register for access to your account on Fidelity [NetBenefits](https://www.netbenefits.com) who is GitLab's plan recordkeeper. For more information about Fidelity, please check out this [Brainshark video](https://https://www.brainshark.com/1/player/fidelityemg?fb=0&r3f1=&custom=gitlab).
1. Any changes to your plan information will be effective on the next available payroll.
1. Once inside the platform you may elect your annual/pay-period contributions and investments.
1. If you have any questions about making changes to your elections, we recommend that you reach out to Fidelity directly, by chat in the app, or by phone at 800-835-5097. 
1. Please review the [Summary Plan Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k1xWqZ-2HjOWLv_oFCcyBkTjGnuv1l_B/view?usp=sharing) and [QDIA & Fee Disclosure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16NeEohph3ycw7ARff240dZWTzdRshDbv/view?usp=sharing). If you have any questions about the plan or the documents, please reach out to Total Rewards at `total-rewards@gitlab.com`. Total Rewards is not able to advise you on your financial decisions.

### 401(k) Match
 
GitLab offers matching 50% of contributions on the first 6% of allocated gross earnings per pay period with a yearly cap of $1,500 USD. If a hypothetical team members salary is $50,000 USD, their gross pay per period is $50,000 / 24 = $2083.33. This is then matched at a rate of $2083.33 * 6% * 50% = $62.50.

As of 1 August, 2022 GitLab has removed the vesting schedule for the employer match. All prior employer match amounts have fully vested as of 1 August, 2022, new employer match contributions will automatically vest when received. 

As you are eligible to participate in GitLab's 401k as of your hire date, you are *also* eligible for GitLab matching contributions as of your hire date.
 
All employer contributions are pre-tax contributions. Team members can still make Roth 401(k) team member contributions and receive pre-tax employer contributions to your Traditional 401(k) account.
 
**Administration of the 401(k) Match:**
* The employer will use the calculation on each check date effective as of January 1, 2019.
* The team member must have a contribution for a check date to be eligible for the employer match.
* Employer matching will be released into participant accounts three business days after the check date.

### WEX (Discovery Benefits) Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts
 
If you are enrolled in a Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA) or commuter benefits, the funds are held through WEX (Discovery Benefits). After your benefit enrollment effective start date, [create an account with WEX (Discovery)](https://benefitslogin.discoverybenefits.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) to manage your funds. You will only receive one debit card upon enrollment. To obtain a second card (for a dependent, etc.) you will need to login to your account on WEX (Discovery) or call and they will send one to your home of record.

#### Health Savings Account (HSA)

GitLab contributes $100 per month for those enrolled in the HSA.

If you would like to transfer your HSA from a previous account, please contact WEX (Discovery) and request a HSA Transfer funds form. On the form you will put your old HSA provider’s account number and any other required personal information. You will then submit the form to WEX (Discovery), and they will get in contact with your old HSA provider and process the transfer of funds. You can reach WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`. 

If you would like to adjust your HSA contributions please log into [PlanSource](https://benefits.plansource.com/). 

HSAs roll over completely year-to-year and are 'owned' by the team member. If you leave GitLab and would like to keep your HSA account, GitLab will no longer be responsible for the administration fee. The account holder will become responsible for the $2.50 per month admin fee.
 
Domestic Partner Reimbursements: If the team member is not legally married to their domestic partner, the domestic partner's expenses are not eligible for disbursement from the HSA. However, if the domestic partner is covered under the family HDHP through the team member, the domestic partner can open their own HSA and contribute up to the full family contribution maximum. The team member may also contribute up to the full family contribution maximum to their own HSA.

#### Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Plans

FSAs help you pay for eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent day care expenses on a pretax basis. You determine your projected expenses for the Plan Year and then elect to set aside a portion of each paycheck into your FSA. FSA contributions can only be updated during open enrollment or through a [qualifying life event (QLE)](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#qualifying-life-events).

FSAs typically have a $550 rollover each calendar year. This is subject to change as dictated by the IRS. Due to COVID legislation, the IRS is allowing for unlimited carryover of FSA funds from 2021 to 2022. Starting in 2022 the IRS increased the FSA rollover amount to $570. 

In 2023 the maximum salary deferral contribution has increased to $3,050 USD, with the maximium rollover amount increasing to $610 USD

FSAs are employer-owned accounts. If you leave GitLab, your FSA account will be terminated on your date of termination unless you continue this through COBRA. You are able to use your full FSA amounts up to and on your last day, but not afterwards unless you enroll into COBRA. WEX (Discovery) asks that all claims be submitted up to 90 days after termination date. You can enroll into COBRA FSA if you have spent less out of your account than you have contributed to it. If you decide to enroll, you will be required to continue making your monthly contributions on a post-tax status.  For additional information, please reach out to WEX (Discovery) at 866.451.3399 or `customerservice@discoverybenefits.com`.
 
FSAs (and Dependent Care FSAs) are subject to annual testing by the Internal Revenue Code guidelines to ensure the pre-tax benefits do not disproportionately benefit highly compensated employees. At the end of each plan year, GitLab will work with WTW to conduct the nondiscrimination testing. If a test returns that highly compensated employees benefit, you may not be able to pre-tax the full amount of your election. This can vary each year and is based upon the dollar amount of non-highly compensated employees’ elections.
 
##### FSA Period to Submit Claims
 
Up to 90 days after the plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).

##### 2021 FSA Rollover & DCFSA Extended Grace Period

Due to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the IRS is allowing for unlimited carryover of FSA funds from 2021 to 2022 and an extended grace period of 12 months to utilize Dependent Care FSA funds from 2021 on expenses incurred in 2022. GitLab has opted into this with our vendor, WEX, to allow team members to take advantage of this and no action is required from team members. 
 
#### Commuter Benefits
 
GitLab offers [commuter benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eFM43gu7VPek1Ia0ZqYjhuT25zYjdYTUpiS1NFSXFXc0Vn/view?usp=sharing) which are administered through WEX (Discovery Benefits).  

In 2022 the contribution limits are $280/month for parking and $280 per month of transit. In 2023 the contribution limits are $300/month for parking and $300 per month of transit. These contributions rollover month to month. 

##### Commuter Benefits Period to Submit Claims
 
For active employees: Up to 180 days after plan year has concluded (also known as the runout period).
 
For terminated employees: Up to 90 days after the termination date.
 
### Navia - Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA)

Effective 2022-10-01, GitLab offers a TravelHealth Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) benefit to reimburse eligible team members and their dependents for transportation and lodging expenses related to travel while obtaining medical care not offered within 100 miles of the location the member resides. 

To be eligible for the Travel HRA benefit, team members and their dependents must be enrolled in one of the Cigna Medical Plans. Navia Benefit Solutions administers the HRA benefit.

### Cigna Supplemental Life Insurance/AD&D
 
Team members who wish to elect additional life insurance above what is provided by GitLab through the Basic Life Insurance or elect life insurance for their dependents, can elect [Voluntary Life Insurance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yY1tFJTuj1wCMlorUvnfcgWwZUuP279r/view?usp=sharing) through Cigna.

  * $10,000 of coverage available for children
 
##### Evidence of Insurability
 
If you elect supplemental life insurance greater than the guaranteed issue of voluntary life insurance for yourself or dependent, you or your dependent may be required to complete an evidence of insurability (EOI). If required, you will be prompted and provided with the form during the enrollment process and can also access it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1AjhGGia1QT2U_OC7TnMUtTk50ZuLBN/view?usp=sharing).
 
Please complete this form to the best of your ability, but if you're unsure for any field, please leave it blank. No information needs to be filled out for the ID # field and for security, you may also leave the Social Security Number field blank.
 
Once complete, please send the form to `total-rewards@gitlab.com`. The Total Rewards team will then help fill in any missing information, if applicable, and will forward to the carrier for review. Total Rewards will confirm receipt of the EOI with the carrier, track its status, and the team or the carrier will reach out to the team member with any issues that need to be addressed in order for the EOI to be approved.
 
If you leave GitLab, all supplemental life insurance is not included in COBRA and will terminate on your last day at GitLab unless you choose to continue your or your spouse/children's life insurance directly with the carrier. Please contact the carrier (Cigna) for more information on premiums and setting this up.

### Timeline

You may also contact `total-rewards@ gitlab` at least a week after your termination date and we can send an electronic copy of your COBRA enrollment packet to you if it has been generated.

1. From the day you enroll, you have 45 days to bring your payments to current.
1. You may remain on COBRA for up to 18 months. Please see the COBRA enrollment packet for information on extending COBRA an additional 18 months, if applicable. The state you reside in may allow for additional time on COBRA, but may be more expensive and include only Medical. Please consult the laws for your state for more information.
