## Medical
GitLab offers a private medical plan through VHI which gives you access to cutting-edge medical treatments, health screenings and protection against the high medical costs of private care. GitLab covers 100% of the premiums for team members and eligible dependents.

For a full breakdown of plan descriptions please review the following [Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 details](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pnyWAp71MMYzdsUm1rk0o4gq7k8cdvJO/view?usp=sharing) and [Table of Benefits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0cfnrKSTyQIyAEro3wR7i2aBLHsvXEv/view?usp=sharing).

To find out which hospitals and treatment centers are covered on your plan, please refer to the directories of approved facilities which are available at `Vhi.ie/downloads` or contact VHI directly via the Corporate Advice Line: `056 777 5800`.

**Does Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) Apply?**
From 1st of May 2015, if you are 35 or over when you first take out private health insurance, you will pay an additional amount of 2% for each year that you are aged 35 and over. Please contact VHI if you think this may apply.

### Enroll in the VHI Plan

GitLab's VHI scheme will begin November 1, 2020. You can choose to enroll from this date or from your hire date (if later than Nov 1st). Team members will need to enroll via VHI directly either through the [online portal](https://www.vhi.ie/access/signup) or by calling VHI. Please use the following [enrollment guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YwsQp7ybVZ7cYg5G4EBlPFBJskxmjfqG/view?usp=sharing) to review the plans and retrieve the group scheme number (slide 9) required for enrollment.  When enrolling please enter your GitLab Employee ID as your "Employee Number" and your GitLab Department listed in Workday as your "Cost Centre"

GitLab has selected Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 company wide. If you feel that this does not suit your needs (or family member needs), please call VHI on `056 777 5800` and they will be able to discuss your requirements.

The policy may renew automaticallly at the end of each policy year. If renewed, notification will be sent to the team member by email. 

### Tax Implications of Medical Plans

The health insurance allowance is treated like any other income or allowance under Revenue Commissioners rules. Your normal tax rate including other statutory deductions will apply. You will be liable for Benefit in kind on your health insurance premium, for more information please read [here](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/medical-insurance-premiums/index.aspx). 

## Eye Exams
Team members in Ireland are entitled to regular eye and eyesight exams under the [Safety, Health, and Welfare at Work Regulations 2007](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/si/299/made/en/print#partii-chapv). GitLab will reimburse team members for the cost of the exams. If an eye exam determines that a team member needs glasses solely and exclusively for VDU (visual display unit i.e. computer screen) use, GitLab will reimburse towards the cost of a basic pair of frames and lenses (i.e. not designer frames) up to 140 Euro.

The team member needs to provide documentation (a prescription) from the optician that confirms if the lenses are specifically required for reading a display screen only and not required for general day to day use.

If you are enrolled in the VHI Medical plan, please submit any eligible claims through the plan first, any out of pocket cost not covered by the plan can be reimbursed up to the max amount in accordance to the Vision policy

Please submit your receipts via expensify and prescription to Total Rewards.

## GitLab Ireland LTD Leave Policy
 
### Statutory Sick Leave
From 1 January 2023, team members in Ireland are entitled to 3 days of paid sick leave per year (increasing in subsequent years) under the [relevant legislation](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/en/act/pub/0024/index.html). The new entitlement will be phased in as part of a 4-year plan, starting with 3 days Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) per year in 2023, increasing to a maximum of 10 days paid SSP over 4 years, as follows:

- 2023: 3 days
- 2024: 5 days
- 2025: 7 days
- 2026: 10 days

Ireland's statutory sick leave policy is separate from GitLab's [Sick Time policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/#sick-time---taking-and-reporting) but when allowed by law will run concurrently with this leave policy.  If a team member needs more time away, GitLab's Sick Time policy will take precedence. 

#### Statutory Sick Leave Pay Calculations
GitLab will be required to pay a minimum of 70% of an team member’s gross wage, subject to a daily cap of €110, but will continue the team member's salary up to 100%. Team members must identify the absence as sickness-related (and comply with the notification requirements below) in order to receive the SSP.   
    - This daily cap is based on the 2019 average weekly earnings and equates to an annual salary of €40,889.16. It may be revised in the future in line with inflation and changing incomes. 

#### Statutory Sick Leave Eligibility
* Worked for GitLab for more than 13 continuous weeks, and
* Must provide a medical certificate for consecutive absence exceeding 2 days.

#### Applying for Statutory Sick Leave
* If your absences exceed 2 consecutive days, please contact the Absence Management Team `leaves@gitlab.com` and include your medical certificate in the email.  
* Team members must designate all time off for illness as `Out Sick` in PTO by Deel to ensure the Sick Leave is properly tracked. 

#### Illness Benefit
Team Members may also be eligible for Ireland's [Illness Benefit](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/disability_and_illness/disability_benefit.html). Please contact `leaves@gitlab.com` for more information.

### Vacation Leave
* Team members are entitled to a maximum of four weeks of statutory vacation each year, which is calculated in accordance with the [Organisation of Working Time Act of 1997](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1997/act/20/revised/en/html#SEC19). Part-time team members’ entitlement is calculated on a pro-rata basis. Unused statutory vacation time may not be carried over into the following calendar year, other than under exceptional circumstances and with GitLab’s prior written consent. GitLab does not provide pay in lieu of unused statutory vacation entitlement other than on termination of employment. If your employment terminates for any reason, you will receive pay for any accrued but unused statutory vacation entitlement. If your employment terminates, and at the date of termination you have exceeded your statutory vacation entitlement, the excess may be deducted from your final pay. Vacation leave runs concurrently with GitLab PTO. Team members must designate any vacation time taken as `Vacation` in PTO by Deel to ensure that vacation entitlement is properly tracked.
