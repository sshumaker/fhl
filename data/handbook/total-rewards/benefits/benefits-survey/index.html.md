## Global Benefits Survey 

GitLab has incorporated the annual benefits survey as part of the Engagement Survey from 2021 forward. The Total Rewards team will review the engagement scores relating to Benefits along with market data from our Broker, Willis Towers Watson, to iterate on benefits offerings each year. 

If you have any feedback or questions please contact [Total Rewards](/handbook/people-group/#how-to-reach-the-right-member-of-the-people-group).

## Benefits Not Currently Being Implemented

This section serves to highlight benefits that we have previously researched, but have decided not to move forward with implementing at this time. As the company grows, circumstances change, and/or we receive new information, we may decide to revisit any benefits added to this list.

### Telehealth

We researched and selected four vendors to receive more information. Demo calls were conducted with three of these vendors where we learned more about the solutions and pricing. After reviewing the [results of the benefits survey](#global-benefits-survey), there wasn’t enough interest in a telehealth solution to justify the price so we decided to not move forward with any of the vendors at this time.

While we aren't offering a global telehealth solution at this time, team members based in the US who are enrolled in our [Cigna](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#cigna-telehealth) or [Kaiser](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/inc-benefits-us/#kaiser-telehealth) medical plans can access telehealth services through these plans. Other team members may have options for telehealth available to them through their provider.

Further information and corresponding discussion are available under [Compensation Issue #15](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Compensation/issues/15) (internal).

### Coworking Space Agreement

We researched whether there was an account that could be set up with a coworking space chain that would make it easier for team members to utilize these spaces. Three major chains with global coverage were contacted with one responding. After conducting a survey, the type of account this chain offers doesn't align with the way the majority of team members utilize coworking spaces. Team members are still welcome to follow the existing process of [expensing a coworking space](/handbook/finance/expenses/#coworking-or-external-office--space).

Further information, survey results, and corresponding discussion are available under [Total Rewards Issue #30](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/30) (internal).

### Wellness Program

We researched and selected three vendors and conducted a cost analysis with Finance. At this time, it does not fit into the budget for benefits to be offered for FY21, but will be revisited when we evaluate benefits and budget for the next fiscal year. Further information and corresponding discussion are available under [Total Rewards Issue #37](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/37) (internal).

### SafetyWing

SafetyWing is a global medical benefits provider. At this time we will not be offering this benefit globally as we are focused on entity specific benefits (which many have medical plans already in place) and the ongoing international expansion process (where a team member is converted to an employee of either a PEO or a GitLab Entity). Further information, survey results, and corresponding discussion are available under [Total Rewards Issue #124](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/124) (internal).

### Family Planning

GitLab has reviewed adding more comprehensive family planning benefits. We did a introductory call with a company that provides fertility benefits who advised the company would pay claims out of pocket which integrates better with self funded medical plans. Since we are not yet at the size or stage to be self funded it would currently be difficult to offer this benefit. At the time we are able to be self funded we will reevaluate. Further information and corresponding discussion are available under [Total Rewards Issue #196](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/total-rewards/-/issues/196) (internal).
