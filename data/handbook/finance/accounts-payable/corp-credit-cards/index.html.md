## <i class="far fa-flag" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Navan Physical Card Policy Statement
- Navan Physical cards are wholly and exclusively used for the benefit of the business department expenses only.
- Any expense for personal business use must be expensed via Navan as per normal Expenses guidelines.
- The Navan Physical card is issued to team members so they can acquire goods and services without having to process the transaction through the traditional purchasing procedure, such as using purchase requisitions or purchase orders.  
- The introduction of this mode of payment is not to override the procedures set forth in the Company’s Procurement Policy, but to provide an alternative method of purchase for necessary goods and services.
- Navan Physical Card Holders are expected to accomplish business goals while spending company funds in the most cost-effective manner.

## <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="far fa-paper-plane"></i> Getting Started
- Navan Physical Cards are limited to team members in certain positions that require a card.  These cards are not for company wide use.
- If you believe your position qualifies for a card, please reach out to ap@gitlab.com and we will send you the instructions on next steps.

## <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="fas fa-stream"></i> Guidelines for Card Use
- Navan Physical card should not be used to bypass the Procurement process.
- All card charges require a receipt. You can add the receipt once the charge reflects in Navan Physical.
- If a card holder is missing a receipt, a [Missing Receipt Affidavit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179q0Wos-CemLCe1uxgMpZ80JukSC4KYx8JICFgHzN0I/edit#gid=1950482609) will need to be completed and attached to the expense. Note: Missing Receipt Affidavit should be attached as a PDF.
- Ensure to use the appropriate Expense type for proper allocation. If the expense type is not on the list, you may use the “Other” category and add any supporting details in the description field.
- If applicable, add expense tags under "Classifications" to the related purchase. Common expense tag examples include company contributes, marketing campaigns and professional service engagements.
- Non-Permissible items will be declined upon charge. Please ensure to only use the card for items under permissible items only.
- Purchases on your card should not exceed $2,500 for each transaction.
- If your purchase will be over $2,500, you will need to enter a Purchase Requisition in Zip. AP prefers to pay vendors by ACH whenever possible.  For reference to get started with Zip for a vendor who can be paid by normal invoicing and payment methods, see [Zip End Users Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/).
- If a charge is made in error, please reach out to ap@gitlab.com on the process to reimburse Gitlab.  It is a painful process, so we ask to avoid this at all cost.
- Any reports with continuous violations to our policy will be subject to management review and could be taken away for non-compliance.

## <i id="biz-tech-icons" class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Non-Permissible Items for Navan Physical Cards

- Please review our [Expense policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/expenses/) for permissible and non permissible items, as these cards are a physical representation of this policy
- Additionally, the physical cards will decline for the below expenses.  These expenses must be paid by the team member and submitted for reimbursement:
  1. Telecom Internet
  2. Telecom Phone
  3. Professional dues, membership fees
  4. All travel related expenses - airfare, in flight purchases, wifi, baggage costs, transportation, meals, hotels, fuel, mileage, parking, tolls

## GL Coding for Offsites, Events, Swag and Marketing

  At this time, there is not a field within Navan to code these expenses, but will be coming in the future.  For now, for these expenses, please use the “Other” Category.  You will then need to select a GL code.  Here is a list of codes below to assist.  Also, note that each of these expenses will flag as “Out of Policy” (due to not having its own category).  But if they are within guidelines and under $2,500 USD (or equivalent local currency), the AP team will review and approve without further information needed.  

- Brand Marketing: 6150 (non COGS), 5150 (COGS)
- Group Offsites: 6015 (non COGS), 5015 (COGS)
- Marketing Field Events: 6130 (non COGS), 5130 (COGS)
- Marketing Site:  6110 (non COGS), 5110 (COGS) 
- Marketing Programs - Swag: 6135 (non COGS, 5135 (COGS)
