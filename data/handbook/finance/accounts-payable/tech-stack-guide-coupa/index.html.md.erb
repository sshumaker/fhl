### Implementation

Coupa is a cloud-based purchasing and payment platform. It has an easy-to-use interface that improved the way suppliers connect with GitLab. All new purchase orders, invoices and communications are managed through the Coupa Supplier Portal. 

Coupa was implemented in 2 phases. In scope for phase 1 was the implementation of a Supplier Information Management (SIM) system and Coupa Pay (Digital Invoices) for all US and Netherlands payments. Phase 2 consisted on the implementation of Coupa Pay Virtual Card (for ten GitLab entities) and the Supplier Information Management (SIM) system and Coupa Pay for the remaining entities (GmbH, PTY LTD, LTD, Canada, Japan, Ireland, Korea, France and Singapore) which fully replaced Tipalti.
