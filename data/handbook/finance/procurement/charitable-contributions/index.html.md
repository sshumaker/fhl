# Charitable Contribution Requests

If you have a request to donate GitLab funds to a charitable cause, please create a new Issue [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=#), select the "Charitable Contribution Request" template from the Description dropdown, and fill out all the requested information. Please note that all charitable contributions must receive Board approval, so please allow 1-3 months for processing and approval.

Once you submit your Issue, the request will go first to your manager and the PAO for approval; the PAO will then take it to the Board. Once you have manager, PAO, and Board approval documented in the Issue, AP and Procurement will send instructions to the recipient to enter their banking details in Coupa so that payment can be issued.

If you have any questions, please reach out to Procurement through the #procurement Slack channel.
