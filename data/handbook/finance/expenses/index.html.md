## <i class="far fa-paper-plane" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Introduction

Welcome to the Expenses page! You should be able to find answers to most of your questions here. If you can't find what you are looking for, then:  

- **Email**: `expenses@gitlab.com`
- [**Navan Expense Guide**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/navan-expense-guide/)

GitLab utilizes Navan as our team member expense reimbursement tool. All team members will have access to Navan as part of the Onboarding process. If you didn't receive an email from Navan for your access, please contact the AP team through one of the channels listed above.
**Note**: Ensure to opt-out from news by logging in and navigating to `Profile > Notifications > Product updates and communication` and un-checking the box.

The procedure by which reimbursable expenses are processed varies and is dependent on contributor legal status (e.g. independent contractor, employee) and [subsidiary assignment](/handbook/tax/#tax-procedure-for-maintenance-of-gitlabs-corporate-structure). Check with Payroll if you are unsure about either of these.

Team members should also consider the terms and conditions of their respective contractor agreements when submitting invoices to the company.

Team members are reimbursed on different schedules depending on their location. Please see the reimbursement process below to find the listing of reimbursement dates based on your location or employment status.

## <i class="far fa-flag" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> General Guidelines

* Itemized receipts are required for all expenses.  Receipts must contain vendor name, date of purchase, listing of what was purchased, and contains a full breakout of the subtotal and tax amounts.
* Items over 90 days from purchase date will not be reimbursed.
* The maximum monthly limit to be reimbursed is $5K USD (or local currency equivalent).
* Expenses that span longer than a month must be submitted on a monthly basis (i.e. although you paid for a year upfront for the internet, you must divide the total by 12 months and submit the cost monthly).
* Gift cards are not accepted as a form of payment for business expenses.
* Expense report items must clearly state if the spend includes amounts for clients / non-team members. Tax requirements in certain countries require us to account for client spending differently.
* All internet/telephone reimbursements must have a detailed receipt attached which shows the amount, service, and service date.
   - Please note we do not reimburse late fees, initial set up, or equipment costs, including ipads, mobile phone handsets, airpods, routers.
   - We do not reimburse for additional services on your telecoms provider bill, i.e. Television package, additional sim cards, family packs.
   - If an itemized bill is not available , costs will only be reimbursed for the element relating to Internet Access , i.e. if you pay for tv, internet & phone - the invoice should be divided by 3 /# of services and we will pay this value only.
* Anything submitted outside of these guidelines will be flagged as Out of Policy.
* All work-related expenses (internet, co-working space, other monthly subscription, etc.) are not reimbursable while on Leave of any kind.

### Out of Policy Transactions

* The AP Team will administer the policy as per the Expense Handbook.
* Note that expenses flagged as “Out of Policy” does not necessarily mean it is “out of policy”- it can also mean that certain expenses require additional review due to requiring certain attachments (ie an approved issue) and approvals.
* Upon review, if more clarification is needed for a certain expense, the AP team will contact the team member in the Navan tool to ask for justification of the transaction before approving or rejecting the expense.
* The AP team will reach out to the team member’s manager if additional approval is needed.
* If the claim is over the advised guidance, the claim will be rejected with a note for the team member.  The team member should be able to rectify the claim and resubmit.
* Any claim made which does not fall into the policy is not reimbursable.
* There will be occasions where if you have claimed an item and it needs to be reimbursed back to Gitlab, you will need to follow the reimbursement process in Navan for submission of the funds.

### Manager Expectations

* Managers are expected to review their team’s expenses in their entirety every month, and must flag any concerns immediately to the Accounts Payable team.
* Managers will be held accountable for any unreported abuse of their team members.
* Managers must be aware of the policy guidance and advise team members as such when requests for purchase are made.
* AP will flag Managers if further information is required for their direct reports.
* Please see the attached [Manager Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQF-_fDIkjsmq-ExsFQwwTW-x8rocGKSDRZVdMYQudA/edit) for more details.

## Expense Policy Outline

Please note that although the policy says “$0.00” in some expense categories of the policy in Navan,  it does not mean that it is not reimbursable. It just means that all expenses submitted under that category will need to be reviewed by the AP team.

All amounts listed below are in USD. Your Navan Profile will default your base currency as per your geographical location.  Please refer to “How Exchange Rates are Calculated” section below.

Use GL Code COGS if you are with the following Department, otherwise please use GL Code Non-COGS.

### Missing a Receipt?

If a team member is missing a receipt, a Missing Receipt Affidavit will need to be completed and attached to the expense when submitted.
Missing Receipt Affidavit located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/179q0Wos-CemLCe1uxgMpZ80JukSC4KYx8JICFgHzN0I/edit?usp=sharing) (please ensure to make a copy).
When attaching the receipt affidavit, you should attach the document as a PDF.

### How Exchange Rates are Calculated

The handbook [uses USD when describing budgets](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#fine-points). When budgeting and submitting expenses in other currencies, team members should use live currency conversion rates (exchange rates). These can be looked up online using a site such as [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/).

**Example:** a team event has a meal budget of USD25 per person. A team member notes that this is $50 in local currency, at current exchange rates. The team member can purchase a meal in their local currency up to $50, and expense it in their local currency.

**Example:** when visiting other countries - you should convert the currency to your local currency when submitting the expense. Currency rate should be done using rates on the day the expense occurred (these can be looked up online using a site such as [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/en/)). i.e. if you spent EUR50 whilst visiting Germany but you live in the UK, you should convert the EUR50 to GBP43.66 (your local Currency) and submit the expense with the valid receipt.

Note: live exchange rates do not apply to compensation, which [uses fixed exchange rates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#exchange-rates).

### How Mileage Rates are Based

The mileage rate is based on your legal entity’s mileage rates for the current year.  These will be updated yearly for tax compliance.  However, for the following entities (due to limited visibility online), the default rate is set at $.50/mile… so please update the rate on your mileage if needed to match your local compliance laws:  Gitlab IT BV, Gitlab Korea and Gitlab Japan.

2. [Expense reimbursement template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0kWlqol7jBjqn7yDY6uc7UCWSIcUmiF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108533621432009168804&rtpof=true&sd=true) is filled out and returned to Payroll.

### Spend reduction

When reducing spend, we'll not take the easy route of (temporarily) reducing discretionary spending.
Discretionary spending includes expenses like travel, conferences, gifts, bonuses, merit pay increases and Contributes.
By reducing in these areas we put ourselves at risk of [increasing voluntary turnover among the people we need most](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/).
Discretionary spending is always subject to questioning, we are frugal and all spending needs to contribute to our goals.
But we should not make cuts in reaction to the need to reduce spend; that would create a mediocre company with mediocre team members.
Instead, we should do the hard work of identifying positions and costs that are not contributing to our goals.
Even if this causes a bit more disruption in the short term, it will help us ensure we stay a great place to work for the people who are here.

### Expense Reimbursement for Terminated Team Members

If a team member whom you managed has left GitLab and comes to you with final expenses that are valid for reimbursement, please verify that they were not already processed in Navan and then contact Accounts Payable. You must submit valid receipts and a completed copy of the [Expense Reimbursement template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0kWlqol7jBjqn7yDY6uc7UCWSIcUmiF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108533621432009168804&rtpof=true&sd=true) along with your approval. Please note that we may also ask the terminated team member to provide valid banking details in order to process the payment to them. 
AP will do their best to process and pay the reimbursement to the individual within 1 week.

### Don’t See an Expense on the List?

Then the expense is not reimbursable.  Please refer to our [Zip](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide/) handbook page on the steps for creating a purchase order or requesting a virtual card.

If an item that needs to be purchased is not on the list, then an issue will need to be created and submitted for approval from Department VP and PAO/Finance approval. This needs to be done prior to purchasing the item or it will be rejected.
