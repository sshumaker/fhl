## Timekeeping

### What time increments should team members record on their timesheets?

Team members should always record the exact time they start working and the exact time they stop working. Likewise, team members should always record the exact time they start a meal period and the exact time they return to work.

### Why do I have to keep track of my time?

US law requires timekeeping for all overtime-eligible roles. It is the only way we can keep an accurate record of your work and non-work hours and be sure we are correctly compensating you for all hours worked.

### What if I forget or am unable to submit my timecard by the due date?

Payroll will send reminders to team members of their timecard submission, and to managers of their timecard approval due dates. 

If you are a salaried non-exempt team member, you will receive your base salary if you forget or are unable to submit a timecard in time. If you are an hourly non-exempt team member, you will receive payment for your stated hours per week as described in your offer letter. You will be prompted by Payroll to submit any corrections to your timecard after the fact to ensure you are accurately paid for any overtime if applicable, as well as any OOO time is tracked correctly, as applicable. Any corrected hours will be added to your following pay period as a separate line, unless you reside in a state that requires a corrected payment within a certain time period.

### Will this change impact my ability to work async or in a non-linear way?

Being overtime-eligible doesn’t change the way you work, or how GitLab as a whole sees you. All team members are able to work asynchronously or non-linearly, provided you adhere to our Meal and Rest Break policy and track the hours you work and the breaks you take. As a non-exempt team member, if you work overtime, as described in our handbook here and defined by State and Federal law, you will be paid at overtime rates. GitLab requires manager approval prior to non-exempt team members working overtime. 

The way that a team member works in a regular workweek should not change dramatically, unless a team member has a habit of working over 8 hours per day regularly. 

For example, team member A is used to working Monday - Thursday for 10 hours per day and then 2 hours on Friday. They live in California. When looking at our [Overtime](/handbook/finance/timekeeping/#overtime) policy, California’s overtime policy means that this team member will be paid 1.5x their regular rate for the 2 additional hours Monday - Thursday (8 hours total) and 1.5x their regular rate for the additional 2 hours on Friday that pushes them over 40 hours per week. Their pay statement will show payment for 32 hours at their regular rate + 10 hours at 1.5x. 

Working overtime without prior authorization may result in disciplinary action. It is the manager's responsibility to review timecards. If overtime is submitted without prior authorization, please communicate with your direct report to better understand what happened, and to reiterate our overtime approvals policy.

## Time Off

### Do I still need to track my time off as outlined by our PTO policy?

In addition to continuing to submit your OOO through PTO by Deel, you must also log certain types of OOO in the ADP Timekeeping system, as listed in the GitLab Non-Exempt & Time and Attendance training. Team members who are taking time off during the day must not record more than 8 hours total of time worked and paid time off.

### Do team members need to record and be paid for time worked during off hours?

Yes. Team members must accurately record and receive pay for all time worked, including time worked during off hours. As previously mentioned, team members must obtain your approval before working any hours in excess of 8 in a day (in California or Alaska) or 40 in a week (in all states). If a team member performs work during off hours without permission, the time must be paid; however, managers should have a conversation with the team member to ensure they do not work unapproved overtime in the future.



## Work hours

### My role requires that I travel for business. Does GitLab pay for that travel time?

Travel time (except for the regular commute time) is considered hours worked and therefore, overtime-eligible team members must be paid for that time. Managers should reach out to their PBP to understand the hours a team member would be paid for travel. For example, if a team member travels during their regular work hours, it would simply be considered work time. If, during a work day, work and travel time totals more than 8 hours, then the additional time, be it work or travel, is overtime. 

### What if a team member needs to run out for a doctor’s appointment or to run an errand – can they make this time up later in the day or the following day?

Yes, team members will continue to have flexibility to run personal errands during the workday. Team members should let their managers know if they will be working different hours than usual, and are required to get approval if they anticipate working overtime. 

### What if my team member checks an email at night, accepts a meeting invite or is on a short phone call that takes a few minutes?  Do they need to record this as working time?

Yes.  All time worked **must be recorded** and managers should emphasize this to their team members.

### Can I allow my overtime-eligible team members to triage email when they are on vacation?

When an overtime-eligible team member is on vacation, managers should designate a back-up team member to cover work issues that might come up and respond to emails on their behalf. In the extraordinary case where an overtime-eligible team member must work on an urgent issue or a large strategic matter while on vacation, the team member should get manager permission in advance to work while on vacation. The team member must record all of the time spent working on vacation. For example, if a team member works one hour during a vacation day, the team member must record only 7 hours of paid time off, and one hour must be recorded as regular work time.

## Overtime

### Is there a limit on the amount of overtime I can work or ask for?

Overtime should be an exception, not the norm, for you to successfully perform your role at GitLab. While we do not have a specific limit of overtime that you are allowed to work, we do expect you to be obtaining pre-approval and discussing the business need for overtime with your manager. 

### Will overtime-eligible team members be compensated for offsite meetings or trainings?

Yes. If an overtime-eligible team member is required or expected to attend offsite events, they must be paid for that time, including any time that would be eligible as overtime. With manager approval in advance, these overtime hours will be allowed.  

### How can managers track how much OT is being worked on a quarterly basis?

ADP has a team dashboard where managers can view hours worked and individuals that are approaching overtime. There are also reports that managers can run to see if anyone is approaching overtime or to view hours worked for a specific time period. Instructions to the dashboard and reports are included in the GitLab Non-Exempt & Time and Attendance Training for Managers. **LevelUp LINK**

### If a team member works overtime without manager permission, what happens?

While company policy requires that team members obtain approval from their manager before working overtime, all overtime work must be paid, even if it is unauthorized. Managers must never say or do anything that might discourage a team member from reporting all time that they have actually worked. Working “off the clock” is unlawful and is not permitted at the GitLan. In circumstances in which overtime is not authorized, the manager should take appropriate corrective actions and work to understand the situation.

## Managers

### What is the FLSA and why is it my responsibility?

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was established in 1938 to abolish child labor, establish a minimum wage, create recordkeeping requirements, and determine which employees would be eligible for overtime pay.

The FLSA does not require:

- Vacation, holiday, severance, or sick pay
- Meal or rest periods*, holidays off, or vacations (*but some states require meal or rest periods, with very strict rules on when/how long these must be)
- Premium pay for weekend or holiday work
- A discharge notice, reason for discharge, or immediate payment of final wages to terminated employees
- Any limit on the number of hours in a day or days in a week an employee at least 16 years old may be required to work or scheduled to work
- Pay raises or fringe benefits

Team members who are classified as “exempt employees” are not eligible for overtime pay. To be exempt, a team member must be paid on a salary basis for at least $684 per week and must perform certain executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, or computer professional job duties.

Team members who are classified as “non-exempt employees” must receive at least minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay for any hours worked more than 40 in a workweek (or more per day in certain states).

As a manager, it is important to manage the hours worked by your direct reports. Non-exempt employees must be compensated for all hours worked in a workweek, including work that is not requested but “suffered or permitted” (i.e., even if not requested, you had reason to know it was being performed). This includes:

- Time spent checking email, Slack messages, or other messages before clocking in or after clocking out
- Time spent during a meal period if the team member is not completely relieved of duties during their unpaid meal period
- Time spent in training **unless**
  - Attendance is outside regular working hours
  - Attendance is voluntary
  - The course, lecture, or meeting is not job related
  - The team member does not perform any productive work during attendance
- Travel time may also be considered working time if it is travel that keeps a non-exempt employee away from home overnight and the employee actually performs work

### My team members are supposed to get my approval before working overtime. How do I determine if I should approve the overtime?

Team members will submit an email to their manager with the following information:

- Date of overtime requested
- Estimated number of hours
- Explanation why the work cannot be completed during regular working hours

Managers should then review the request and consider whether the work can be postponed until the next working day or distributed to others. Reasons to grant overtime may include:

- An upcoming deadline
- Normal resources, including other team members, are not available
- A sudden change in demand and/or workload

Additionally, when determining how to allocate workload, you should think about how long you foresee this increased demand and/or workload to continue.

Managers should review the amount of OT requested and amount approved/denied on a monthly basis with their PBPs to address whether they have resources properly allocated.

### What do managers need to do differently to manage overtime-eligible team members?

There are two main responsibilities for managing overtime-eligible team members:

**Reviewing and Approving Time Recorded**

There are additional recordkeeping requirements for overtime-eligible team members. Managers must ensure that their direct report completes their timesheet accurately and completely, showing daily “ins” and “outs” and meal breaks. 

Although team members must keep accurate and detailed timesheets, managers will continue to have the same flexibility to manage work schedules, if applicable. Please keep in mind that GitLab must pay team members for **all hours worked**, so it is important that managers are mindful of the financial impact that overtime creates. For example, hours worked in excess of 8 in a day (in California and Alaska) and 40 in a week (in all states) must be recorded and must be paid at [overtime rates](/handbook/finance/timekeeping/#overtime).

**Wage and Hour Compliance**

Managers are responsible to ensure that GitLab complies with the wage and hour requirements under US federal and state law. This includes:
 
- Ensuring that your team members accurately and completely record all hours worked; 
- Ensuring that your team members are not working “off the clock” or on a voluntary, unpaid basis; and 
- Ensuring that your team members are aware of the rest breaks and meal policies.  

**Again, it is every manager's responsibility to ensure that your team member is aware of GitLab's meal and rest break policies.**
