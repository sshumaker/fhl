## What are ITGCs?

ITGCs, or IT General controls (sometimes referred to at GITCs - General IT controls), are a subset of the SOX internal control set. The objectives of ITGCs are to ensure the integrity of the data and processes that the [in scope systems](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/finance/sox-internal-controls/it-general-controls/) support. They can be applied at the application, OS, database and infrastructure layers.
