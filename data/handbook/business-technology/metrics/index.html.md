# Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

## Engineering Contribution Rate

Engineering Contribution Rate is a key indicator showing how productive our team members are based on two factors. 
1. the total MRs created for contributions to GitLab or to IT Applications 
  - [Handbook Link](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it/engineering/development/)
1. the number of IT engineering issues that are actioned each month. 
  - [Access requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it/engineering/access-mgmt/)
  - [IT infrastructure](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it/engineering/infrastructure/) 
  - [IT Eng Ops](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/engineering/operations/issue-tracker/-/issues) 
  - [IT change management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/it/engineering/change-mgmt/)

Target: TBD

## FinSys team Contribution Rate

FinSys Contribution Rate is a key indicator showing how productive our team members are based on the total change management issues that are completed per month. 

Target: TBD

## Laptop on-time delivery

This performance indicator tracks the number of laptops that arrive before a team members start date. 

Target: The goal is that 95% of laptops will arrive prior to start date.

## CSAT of IT Requests

This performance indicator measures how satisfied our customers' (internal GitLab team members) are with their interaction with the GitLab IT team. This is based on survey responses from team members.

Target: 95% CSAT

Note: This cannot be measured currently.

## Cycle Time for IT Support Issue Resolution SLA

This performance indicator tracks against the SLA for requests.

**Aligns with the following core business objectives**:

- Triage all IT related questions as they arise
- On call support for immediate software and hardware issues during local business hours

Target: 95% SLA achievement

Note: This cannot be measured currently.


# Performance Indicators (PI)

## All teams

### Average Merge Requests to the handbook

This performance indicator tracks the growth of the knowledge base across teams.

**Aligns with the following core business objectives**:

**Data Team**

- Follow and improve our processes for maintaining high quality data and reporting.
- Ensure goal to keep systems up and running while giving insights into partnership with Infrastructure team.
- Ensure data availability for data analytics and reporting for business units to make data-driven decisions.

**IT Systems**

- Build a knowledge base of IT practices and pragmatic problem solving in the handbook
- Support Weekly IT Onboarding Sessions for new Team Members
- Train end-users how to setup and use new technologies

### Cost Actual vs Plan

This performance indicator is tracked by several metrics including: Infrastructure Cost vs Plan and Hiring Cost vs Plan. This PI is to track the financial position of all the team cost vs. the budget set by the team.


## Enterprise Applications

### Evaluating System or Process Efficiency

This performance indicator tracks the efficiency of new or updated system or processes.

**Aligns with the following core business objectives**:

- Understand system capabilities and business requirements, and drive standard & scalable solutions. Anticipate risks and mitigating them before they become serious.
- Identify opportunities to increase efficiency and productivity within the context of the overall business strategy

### System roll out vs plan

This performance indicator tracks the time it took to roll out a new system vs the planned time for that system roll out.

**Aligns with the following core business objectives**:

- Creating a roadmap for system changes
- Understanding bandwidth constraints on the IT team

## IT Security

### Security Tool Coverage

These performance indicators track the coverage of security tools on systems belonging to active Okta accounts. An account is considered active if it has logged into Okta at least once within the last 21 days. Contractor, service and admin accounts are excluded from the count of active Okta accounts. Active accounts are further split between MacOS and Linux systems, although some users may use both (and will be counted in both totals). 

To avoid double counting, only one system per operating system type (i.e. MacOS or Linux) is counted per Okta account.

#### Jamf Coverage

This metric counts the number of MacOS systems that have reported to the Jamf console in the last 21 days, and divides it by the total number of active Okta MacOS accounts.  

#### SentinelOne MacOS coverage

This metric counts the number of MacOS systems that have reported to the SentinelOne console in the last 21 days, and divides it by the total number of active Okta MacOS accounts.

#### Filesystem (FS) MacOS encrypted

This metric counts the number of MacOS systems that have reported to the Jamf console that their filesystem is encrypted, and divides it by the total number of active Okta MacOS accounts.

#### DriveStrike Linux Coverage

This metric counts the number of Linux systems that have reported to DriveStrike console in the last 21 days, and divides it by the total number of active Okta Linux accounts.

#### SentinelOne Linux coverage

This metric counts the number of Linux systems that have reported to the SentinelOne console in the last 21 days, and divides it by the total number of active Okta Linux accounts.
