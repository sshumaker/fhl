## Procedure

### Getting a new phone, lost/broken Yubikey or TouchID not working for Okta and Gitlab

#### Gitlab

- For 2FA related problems for your GitLab accounts, please use your backup codes or try generating [new ones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/account/two_factor_authentication.html#generate-new-recovery-codes-using-ssh).
- If you are locked out completely reach out in `#it_help` Slack channel

#### Okta

WebAuthn is now required for all Okta users. Refer [to these instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/okta/#i-want-to-add-touch-id--face-id--yubikey-to-okta) on how to configure

- If your TouchID, Yubikey or Mobile Authentication is not working make sure your OS and phone is updated to the latest version
- Try to login with different browsers (Chrome and Safari)
- Reach out in `#it_help` if all else fails
- 2FA resets will require a Zoom call with an IT team member who will ask you to hold your government ID with your address (ex. Drivers license) up to your webcam to have us verify your picture and postal address against your Workday postal address. This is for security verification




### Clearing Browsing Data in Advanced Settings Below Will Cause Issues With Your WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID)

Do **not do** the following when clearing cache and cookies in Google Chrome as this will clear WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID) browsing data and cause issues logging in:

- In Chrome ⇒ Click on 3 dots on top right corner
- Go to More Tools ⇒ Clear browsing data
- Under advanced ⇒  DO NOT Check box below
- This will clear your WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID) and will need to be reset and configured again

![clearing cache](./cache1.png "Cache")

If you cleared your cache and got locked out please do the following:

- Use Yubikey to login to Okta and reset WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID) and configure again.
- If your phone is set up with a passkey, you may use your phone to get into OKTA and reset your WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID)
- If you do not have a Yubi key or your phone set up; you will need to contact #it-help to reset your WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID) in OKTA

Please check out the [following page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/okta/#i-want-to-add-touch-id--face-id--yubikey-to-okta) for information and assistance on setting up WebAuthN (Biometrics/Touch ID)/Phone passkey and Yubikey

### Forgot my password

If you require IT to reset your password and it requires immediate access, please reach out on the slack #it_help channel and provide as much information as possible. Password resets to sensitive systems such as your Google Workspace account and Okta. They require a Zoom call with an IT Analyst to verify that it is you before doing the reset, this is required for security purposes.

### Using GMail app on phone with Okta log in

Please refer to our GitLab Accceptable Use Policy on [Personal Phones Mobile Phone and Tablet Usage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/acceptable-use-policy/#personal-mobile-phone-and-tablet-usage) prior to adding your GitLab GMail account to your personal device.

### How to Erase a Disk for Mac

If you are keeping your GitLab machine [Laptop Buy Back Policy](/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#laptop-buy-back-policy) it is required that IT wipes the machine and restores it to base OS. We currently use 2 products to accomplish this task and you can read more about this here - [Remote Wipe procedure](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/#fleet-intelligence--remote-lockwipe).

#### Jamf (MacOS)

- Please schedule a time with an IT Analyst to have your laptop wiped. You can find their schedules[here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/#laptop-wipe-schedules-for-it-analysts).
- Make sure all your data is backed up and laptop is powered on and connected to the internet
- Please refer to your refresh [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues) which contains further instructions

#### Drivestrike (Linux)

- Please schedule a time with an IT Analyst to have your laptop wiped. You can find their schedules[here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/#laptop-wipe-schedules-for-it-analysts).
- Please refer to your refresh [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues) which contains further instructions

- We will send you an email which will contain install instructions for Drivestrike

#### Transferring of data to new mac

- We do NOT recommend the use of Migration Assistant to transfer your data to your new mac as this will break the connectivity of JAMF
- Please use GitLab's Google Drive function to back up what is needed and then you're able to download this onto your new mac

### Does your Gmail account keep getting suspended?

This usually occurs when the emails you send out get reported for spam. Collect too many reports and Google will automatically suspend your account. Here is some more info on Google's [page](https://support.google.com/a/topic/28609).

**How do I get access to my account after suspension?**

Someone from IT will need to unlock your account. Please submit a [Team Member Enablement request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request) or reach out to us on the #it-help slack channel.

**How do I prevent this from happening?**

Please look into the following mailing applications which may prevent this from happening in the future due to a different mailing method.

- MailGun: <https://www.mailgun.com/>
- MailChimp: <https://mailchimp.com/>

Both of those applications are listed in GitLab's tech stack meaning they can be used.

Request for support should have an issue open at [IT Help Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request).

### How to Contact Us or Escalate Priority Issues Outside of Standard Hours

We ask that all requests are made through an [IT Help Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20HelpDesk%20Request). We will triage and address them as soon as we can. All issues created in the queue are public by default. Privileged or private communications should be sent to [it-help@gitlab.com.](mailto:it-help@gitlab.com.) Screenshots and videos are very helpful when experiencing an issue, especially if there is an error message.

As a distributed team, we have support around the clock with team members in North America, Europe and Australia.
High volumes of issues being triaged can dictate the delay in response within that window. If the issue is extremely time sensitive and warrants escalation, use judgement on whether or not it can wait until ‘business hours’.
Escalated issues should be made through the #it_help slack channel.
All other request should have an issue created.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this procedure will be tracked as per the [Information Security Policy Exception Management Process](/handbook/security/#information-security-policy-exception-management-process).
