GitLab has chosen to restrict the ability to install apps, and we have a process to approve or restrict certain apps for our workspace. In order to integrate a new app with existing applications in our [tech stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml) such as Slack, you need to create a [vendor approval issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=app_integrations).

### Adding an app to Slack

Once the [vendor approval issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/procurement-team/procurement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=app_integrations) has been approved by all parties, please request approval to add the app to Slack following the steps below:

1. Make sure the app hasn't been pre-approved by our team by clicking on Apps in the left sidebar and find Available Apps. To find pre-approved apps in the App Directory, click Pre-Approved below Categories in the left column.
1. If the app isn't pre-approved, you can click on Add to Slack.
1. Add a custom message with more context about your request and also link the vendor approval issue.
1. Click Submit. You'll receive a direct message from Slackbot when your request has been reviewed by the team.

**Please note that this is only required for new apps that have not been reviewed or approved.** If your request is to add a new  process or update an existing process for how an application works in slack, please refer to our [Business Technology Change Management](/handbook/business-technology/change-management/) process.

### Adding an app/plugin to other systems owned by Team Member Enablement/Business Technology

If you need to add an app/plugin that connects with other systems owned by IT (not Slack), please create an issue in the [Team Member Enablement Issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/team-member-enablement/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=App_Integration) and follow the steps outlined there.
