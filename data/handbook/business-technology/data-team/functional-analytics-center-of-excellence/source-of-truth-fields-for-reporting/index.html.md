## FACE: Source of Truth Fields for Reporting

**What is this?** Below is a series of tables containing the standard fields to use when pulling data from various systems.

**Why was this created?** To document source of truth data fields and institutional knowledge known by the different functional analytics teams. This will allow us to go into any dashboard or data table and easily understand which fields are trusted sources of truth.

🚧  This page is currently a work in progress. 🚧

Note that every account has 2 addresses:
1. account address; and
2. ultimate parent account (UPA) address.
Example: if this office is located in Denver, but the company headquarters is in New York, you have both of those address values on the Account. Our sales territories and most of our reporting is done at the UPA level, but there are use cases for the account address as well.

Note that there are 2 versions of segment/geo/region/area:
1. Account fields (account demographics). These are based on characteristics about the Account. Account Demographics Sales Segment is based on employee count, and Account Demographics Geo/Region/Area are based on the geographical location (address) of the ultimate parent in each account hierarchy. These fields are LIVE - if the address changes, the account demo values change as well.
2. User fields are based on characteristics of the Salesforce user (sales reps) who works on a deal. Each user record in Salesforce has fields for segment/geo/region/area, which describe the sales team that the user works for. These fields are maintained by the Sales Ops team. User Segment = Mid-Market means this user works on the Mid-Market sales team. These fields are also LIVE - if a sales rep is hired or promoted, the Sales Ops team will update that rep's user record in Salesforce and change these values.
3. When we measure sales team performance, we stamp the opportunity owner’s user values onto each Opportunity (stamped opp owner user segment), and that tells us which sales team gets credit for this deal. Example: if John worked on the Mid-Market team last year, but he has just been promoted to the Large team, his current user segment = Large. Opps that he closed last year would have been stamped as MM, but opps that he closes after his promotion will be stamped as Large. These fields are STAMPED - once the opportunity is closed, they won't change. These are the only segment values that we can use for historical reporting.

Note regarding product fields:
- Currently we believe product_category is the best of these three product fields. 
    - `fct_crm_opportunity.product_details`
    - `fct_crm_opportunity.product_category` - USE THIS ONE
    - `fct_crm_opportunity.products_purchased`
- However, for the latest data it is only reliable on closed opportunities for closed months (**i.e., after the 8th day of this month, you can report on prior month closed opportunities using product_category**).

_*Note: These `legacy` models will be deprecated in the future in favor of models built in the 
`common` schema. Existing queries, snippets, and dashboards using them can be trusted but any 
net-new code should use common models, when possible._
<br><br>
Models in the `common` schema are built to the Data program's [EDM Standards](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/edw/#enterprise-dimensional-model-governance) 
and are subject to a greater level of validation than the legacy models. Only models in the 
`common*` schemas can meet [Trusted Data Standards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-development/#trusted-data-development), 
and any reference to a legacy a model's lineage makes it ineligible to meet the TD requirements.

**Additional notes**

* Blocked users are filtered out of several legacy models:
  * [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_users_xf`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_users_xf)
  * [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_usage_data_events`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_usage_data_events) 
  and downstream models (ex: [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_daily_usage_data_events`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_daily_usage_data_events))
  * [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_memberships)
* [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_memberships) 
and [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members`](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_members) 
are particularly confusing data sets. Use with caution, always ask for a code review, and do not 
hesitate to reach out to other analysts for help.
