### Build A Better Team
- [CREDIT](/handbook/values/#credit)
- We treat everyone with respect
- We assume best intent towards GitLab success
- We are honest with ourselves and with each other
- We have permission to disagree, but must drive to commitment
- We don’t hide from difficult conversations
- We’re in this together as a team
- We tackle mistakes as a team and seek to get better

### Deliver Results That Matter
- Data-Driven First, Data-Informed Second, Principles & Stories Third
- We believe in built to last, not built too fast
- We operate with a [growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means), continually raising the standard
- We don’t confuse activity with progress
- We know how our work aligns with strategic initiatives and how it will help our Business Partners deliver impactful results
- We go the extra mile to provide Context, Facts, and Insights
- We define expectations up front: Scope, Time, and Success Criteria
- We proactively engage with our Business Partners to ensure regular progress for important initiatives

###  Create Trusted & Scalable Data Solutions
- We all have a responsibility for Data Security and Data Quality
- We lead with well-tested and accurate Data Solutions
- We operate and maintain the production solutions we create
- We design for GitLab +2 years, while delivering for GitLab today
- We maximize the capabilities and services of our vendor-partners
- We believe the best way to align on a complex outcome is to picture it
- Automated tests are the best tests and we implement tests at every step of the data delivery process


### Additional beliefs held by the Data Team include:
* Everything can and should be defined in code and version controlled
* Data implementations should integrate best practices from DevOps into their workflow
* Partner with each Business function while having a high-quality, maintainable code base
* Open source our code, keeping data security and data sensitivity in mind 
* There is a single source of truth for every analytic question within a company, and it is also important to represent multiple perspectives to provide the most thorough data insights
* [Glue work](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/glue-work/) is important for the health of the team and is recognized individually for the value it provides. We expect [everyone to contribute](/handbook/values/#mission). 
* Focus our limited resources where data will have the greatest impact
* All business users should be able to learn how to interpret and calculate simple statistics
