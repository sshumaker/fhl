## Purpose

`This page contains forward-looking content and may not accurately reflect current-state or planned feature sets or capabilities.`

Public companies need to reliably and predictably share key financial, customer, and growth metrics as well as analyze lead-to-cash and product idea-to-adoption processes to continually improve business performance. These activities are supported by capabilities defined in **Level 2** of the [Data Capability Model](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/index.html). To provide a realistic example and to serve as a reference for future development, this page presents the [Level 2 Data Solution](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/#data-capability-model) for 'Product Geolocation Analysis'.

## Solution Overview - Product Geolocation Analysis

Understanding where your product is used around the world is an important step towards developing a more complete understanding of your customers, your product's global reach, and related location-aware insights.

This data solution delivers three [Self-Service Data](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/self-service/) capabilities:

1. Dashboard Viewer - a new Sisense dashboard to visualize GitLab deployments by Country, Territory, Month, and Year (Self-Service Dashboard)
1. Dashboard Developer - a new Sisense data model containing the complete dimensional model components to build new dashboards and link existing dashboards to geolocation data
1. SQL Developer - a new Enterprise Dimensional Model subject area

From a Data Platform perspective, the solution delivers:

1. an extension to the Enterprise Dimensional Model for GeoLocation analysis
1. a new `dim_country` table
1. testing and data validation extensions to the Data Pipeline Health dashboard
1. ERDs, dbt models, and related platform components

Finally, this is the long-term automated solution for several ad-hoc issues completed over the past year, including:

- [Pull customer & user data by Country (internal link)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/3614)
- [Country User Data (internal link)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/4991)
- [Upload GeoLite2 Free Database with Sheetload (internal link)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/3621)

### Knowledge Assessment & Certificates

The Self-Service Data Certificate program is based on the [Learning and Development Certification program](/learn/certifications/public/). The Self-Service Data program provides individual Certificates for each subject-oriented Dashboard Developer or SQL Developer Knowledge Assessment successfully completed. Links to the Knowledge Assessments are located in the appropriate sections below.

#### Self-Service Dashboard Developer Certificate

To receive a Certificate, you will need to earn 100% on [the Self-Service Dashboard Developer Knowledge Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR4BI5RKj9X2fUYGlbtV-L6dUta3oNIWYaDY1X0gPcgzFMHA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and upload a screenshot of your new dashboard when prompted. Upon completion of the Knowledge Assessment, you will be emailed your responses and this email will serve as your Certificate.

### Self-Service SQL Analysis

#### Key Fields and Business Logic

- Data is sourced from usage-ping and snowplow.
- Usage-ping includes information about where the instance is HOSTED, not where the users of the host originate.
- Snowplow includes the best information we have available about where users are originating from.  Because some users deploy GitLab behind [VPNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or a similar proxy solution, the IP-to-Geolocation mapping from these sources may not be accurate. But it is still the best data source we have and represents our best source of truth.

#### Reference SQL

All production SQL in Sisense or dbt must adhere to our [SQL Style Guide](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/sql-style-guide/) for legibility and maintainability.

##### Page views by country by day for NORAM

```sql
SELECT
  f.date_key            AS date_key,
  dc.country_name       AS country_name,
  SUM(f.num_page_views) AS number_of_page_views
FROM fct_country_activity_by_day f
JOIN dim_country dc
  ON f.country_key = f.country_key
WHERE dc.reporting_region = 'NORAM'
```

##### Top 100 namespaces by country in 2020

```sql
SELECT
  dc.country_name       AS country_name,
  f.namespace_key       AS namespace_key,
  SUM(f.num_page_views) AS number_of_total_page_views
FROM fct_country_activity_by_day f
JOIN dim_country dc
  ON f.country_key = f.country_key
WHERE dd.year = 2020
GROUP BY dc.country_name, f.namespace_key
PARTITION BY dc.country_name LIMIT 100
```
