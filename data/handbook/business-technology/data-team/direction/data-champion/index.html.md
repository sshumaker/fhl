## Overview

The Data Champion Program is a modern solution to develop Data Acumen and Data Capabilities across an organization with existing team members. As opposed to relying on a central Data Team for all data needs, the Data Champion Program uses an inside-out and [train-the-trainer](https://www.toolshero.com/management/train-the-trainer/) approach to develop Data from within functional teams, leveraging expertise, content, and programs created by central Data Team experts.

The goals of the Data Champion Program include:

- Leveraging Data as a key company asset and helping everyone make their best decisions with data
- Creating a path for functional teams to become Data self-sufficient, including Self-Service Dashboard development and SQL Analysis
- Accelerating the adoption of data-driven techniques and approaches
- Improving Data Quality and Data Accountability
- Helping to grow an active Data community

## Approach

The Data Champion approach identifies one individual in each functional team to serve as (a) the Data DRI for their team and (b) as a [stable counterpart](/handbook/leadership/#stable-counterparts) to the Data Team. Data Team leadership and the Data Champion collaboratively develop a **Data Success Plan** to define vision, responsibilities, and objectives, taking into consideration the functional team's unique data needs, aptitudes, and existing data acumen. Among other things, the Plan establishes a training schedule covering GitLab Data Assets (reports, dashboards, data models), Self-Service Capabilities, and the Data Roadmap. To help develop Data Acumen within their team, the Data Champion has a responsibility to promote data practices through a local Data competency center.
