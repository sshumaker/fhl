## The Analytics & Insights Team

**What we do:** we analyze data to provide insights and actionable recommendations that influence business decisions resulting in increased revenue, optimized budgets and/or improved customer satisfaction. By doing this we power the virtuous cycle below. We are a strategic team and we think and act strategically.

**Mission:** make data-driven strategy and decision-making a competitive advantage for GitLab.

Analytics and Business Insights reports into FP&A and provides a broad view of performance across the business. Business Insights primarily work on company-wide strategic analysis and data that spans various departments – sales, marketing, product, engineering, people, operations and finance. To the extent this analysis leads to insights that should be produced on a regular basis, Business Insights will work with the Data team to create a self-service dashboard.  The distinction between Business Insights and the Data Team is deep dive analysis that currently doesn’t have a dashboard to drive deeper business insights with data that resides in multiple areas.
