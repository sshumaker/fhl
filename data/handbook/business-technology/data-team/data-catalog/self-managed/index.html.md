## Self-Managed 

**SELF-MANAGED** is a deployment of GitLab that customers manage within their own environment and not within GitLab SaaS. This handbook page on [Choosing between GitLab SaaS and self-managed subscriptions](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) provides a great overview of these two editions.

* Customer Implementations are identified as an Instance.  An Instance can have multiple Installations, ie DEV and PROD.    Each Installation may be hosted on different servers.   
* Subscriptions are assigned at the Instance level and determine the Application Features available.  Instance is the highest level of the Self-Managed License so, the features are cascaded down from there.  [GitLab self-managed subscription](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#gitlab-self-managed-subscription) provides a great overview of the GitLab self-managed subscription and how it is administered.
* Product Usage information is available to the Customer and can be voluntarily sent to Gitlab in collaboration to help enhance the product as outlined in the [Operational Data Vision](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/).  

### Self-Managed Data Components

* Customer Implementation (Instance)
  - Self-Managed Implementations are identified at the Instance level with an Instance_id. A customer may have multiple Installations per Instance with the same instance id and different Host Names, i.e. Prod, Dev or Other Group.
    - Instance_id is synonymous with `uuid` in Service Ping or `dim_instance_id` in our data models
    - Installations are identified using `dim_installation_id` in our data models
  - Each Instance has a set of features that are cascaded down through all Installations per the License Agreemnent
* License
  - A single License is assigned to each Customer Implementation (Instance).  The [license key](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#how-does-the-license-key-work) gives the authorization to activate and use the product. A [maximum number of users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#maximum-users) is assigned for the license period.  Additional users may be added during the License period and handled as [Users over License](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#users-over-license) during renewal.   
* Subscriptions
  - A subscription enables the Features of the product assigned to the Instance.   You can see a full list of features by tier on the [feature comparison](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/feature-comparison/) page. 
* Product Usage   
  * [Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/) -  Service ping data is sent voluntarily from an Instance.  The User and Other Activity is captured as aggregated counts. Since not all customers send service ping data, or send just partial service ping data, there is an [Estimation Algorithm](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/xmau-analysis/estimation-xmau-algorithm.html) used for a more wholistic view of the overall usage. 
  * Product Usage data and use cases is further described [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/product-usage-data/).
  * The systems overview of how the data is brought into GitLab can be seen [here](/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#systems-overview).
 
## Self-Managed Analysis

### Self-Managed Instances
* [dim_installation](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_installation) - table with Instance_id and Host_id with Host Name
* [dim_license](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_license) - table with license and associated Subscription and Product Tier information
* [dim_subscription](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_subscription) - table with Subscription by Version with Account Information
* [dim_crm_account](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_crm_account) - table with CRM (SalesForce) Accounts
* [map_license_subscription_account](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.map_license_subscription_account) - table to map license, subscription and crm accounts
