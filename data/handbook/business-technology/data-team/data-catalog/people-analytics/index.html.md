## People Analytics


The study of people at work! Human resource departments are flipping their approach to organizational behavior and instead of using judgements or opinions to make decisions are making it fact based with the power of data!

## The Benefits of Data in the People Space

- Build a more streamlined talent acquisition process that helps GitLab build a strong and diverse team, as well as provides candidates going through the process a well-crafted experience.
- Drive teams to constantly be improving the experience of GitLab team members, and we mean it when we say "Everyone can contribute." We want individuals to thrive in their careers here and using engagement surveys and KPIs to drive our team goal we put people at the forefront.
- Tie in the other data! Whether it be sales data, engineering data, etc it is all important to us! We want to understand how we can help team members grow in their journey and help leaders understand the impact of their organizations.

## Generic Rules and Guidance

- The People Group should be able to do their daily work within the operational software (BambooHR, Greenhouse, etc.).
- People data in the warehouse should be for reporting general People information “up and out” in the organization.
- Always know the roles and users that have access to the data from “cradle to grave” to understand the risk.
- Only what is needed for reporting should be brought into the data warehouse and leave other potentially sensitive data in the operational tools.
- Anonymize sensitive data that is used in metic calculations and reporting to reduce risk when possible.
