## CI Runner Activity

Previously, there wasn't an easy way to tie cost directly to CI usage without making assumptions. And the process was not scalable, so a better solution was needed for the future.

For this purpose, a Unified model for **CI Minutes/Cost** has been created as a part of [Enterprise Dimensional Model](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/12ee91c1-7ae5-4e99-96ae-bc51652dfa19/view?page=B47EyN20O.G6#) that ties the cost from app usage table (postgres) to `gcp_billing` and labels our runners in GCP with `job_id` labels to join to `ci_builds` table.

### Business Use Cases/Example KPIs:

- Cost of All CI Pipelines run in gitlab-org-gitlab project in January 2021
- Average Cost per pipeline for all GitLab.com CI usage
- Count of CI pipelines run by namespace X last month
- Count of CI minutes run in project X over past year
- Cost of CI minutes run in project X over past year

### Key Field Descriptions

- `CI Build ID` 
    - Sets granularity level of table at level of a single GitLab job that runs (ci_builds table)
- `CI Build Duration` 
    - Currently calculated from start time -> end time of a single job in ci_builds table   
- `Runner type` 
    - Determines scope of runners. See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html for more details. GitLab only pays for shared runners that customers use as well as group/specific runners that are used within our own projects. (ci_runners table)
- `Project ID`
    - Determines what project runner activity linked to and all related info
- `Namespace ID`
    - Determines subscription and if usage is internal or not
- `User ID`
    - Determines user that ran the job

### Table Relationship Details

Most of these fields can be sourced from `gitlab_dotcom_ci_builds`, and related tables are linked to `ci_builds` by using below relationships:
- `ci_runners`: gitlab_dotcom_ci_builds.ci_build_runner_id -> gitlab_dotcom_ci_runners.runner_id
- `ci_stages`: gitlab_dotcom_ci_builds.ci_build_stage_id -> gitlab_dotcom_ci_stages.ci_stage_id
    - ci_pipelines: gitlab_dotcom_ci_stages.pipeline_id -> gitlab_dotcom_ci_pipelines.ci_pipeline_id
    - Stages table is normally used to bridge `pipeline -> builds` but we sometimes use `ci_stage_name` to look at the longest duration by stage.
- `projects`: gitlab_dotcom_ci_builds.ci_build_project_id -> gitlab_dotcom_projects_xf.project_id
    - namespace: gitlab_dotcom_projects_xf.namespace_id -> gitlab_dotcom_namespaces_xf.namespace_id
- `users`: gitlab_dotcom_ci_builds.ci_build_user_id -> gitlab_dotcom_users_xf.user_id

### Sources of Data

Data is sourced from `GitLab.com` models.
    
### Related Data Artifacts

The Data Team maintains these Data artifacts related to `CI Runner Activity` :

- **ERD**
   - The [CI Runner Activity Physical Data Model](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/fe967fe7-5cb8-4a83-96f6-17ba824275b9/edit?beaconFlowId=3414471839151653&invitationId=inv_2c1487d9-d40c-4cda-b983-198344a56a7d&page=csqmM_lDyM2l#) shows all table structures, including column name, column data type, column constraints, primary key, foreign key, and relationships between tables that are used for this data.

- **Data Flow Diagram**
   - The [CI Runner Activity Data Flow diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/fe967fe7-5cb8-4a83-96f6-17ba824275b9/edit?beaconFlowId=3414471839151653&page=0_0&invitationId=inv_2c1487d9-d40c-4cda-b983-198344a56a7d#) provides a high level overviw of how the Data flows in to the `fact model` - [fct_ci_runner_activity](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.fct_ci_runner_activity) and `Mart models` - [mart_ci_runner_activity_monthly](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.mart_ci_runner_activity_monthly) and [mart_ci_runner_activity_daily](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.mart_ci_runner_activity_daily) from `Prep/Intermediate` and other `Dimension` tables. 
<br>

- **Table Definitions**
   - [fct_ci_runner_activity](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.fct_ci_runner_activity) - Fact table containing quantitative data related to CI runner activity on GitLab.com. The grain of the table would be a single GitLab job that ran (successful or not) determined by `dim_ci_build_id` which is the unique key for each CI build.
   - [mart_ci_runner_activity_monthly](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.mart_ci_runner_activity_monthly) - Mart table containing quantitative data related to CI runner activity on GitLab.com. These metrics are aggregated at a monthly grain per `dim_namespace_id`. Additional identifier/key fields - `dim_ci_runner_id`, `dim_ci_pipeline_id`, `dim_ci_stage_id` have been included for Reporting purposes. Only activity since 2020-01-01 is being processed due to the high volume of the data.
   - [mart_ci_runner_activity_daily](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.mart_ci_runner_activity_daily) - Mart table containing quantitative data related to CI runner activity on GitLab.com. These metrics are aggregated at a daily grain per `dim_project_id`. Additional identifier/key fields - `dim_ci_runner_id`, `dim_ci_pipeline_id`, `dim_ci_stage_id` have been included for Reporting purposes. Only activity since 2020-01-01 is being processed due to the high volume of the data.

   
## Self-Service Capabilities

The data solution delivers two [Self-Service Data](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/direction/self-service/) capabilities:

1. **Dashboard Developer**: The CI data related existing Sisense data models containing different widget charts now uses the complete dimensional model components built for CI Runner Activity data.

## Self-Service Data Solution

### Self-Service Dashboard Developer

A great way to get started building charts in Sisense is to watch this 10 minute [Data Onboarding Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4FwRcKb95w&feature=youtu.be) from Sisense. After you have built your dashboard, you will want to be able to easily find it again. Topics are a great way to organize dashboards in one place and find them easily. You can add a topic by clicking the `add to topics` icon in the top right of the dashboard. A dashboard can be added to more than one topic that it is relevant for. Some topics include Finance, Marketing, Sales, Product, Engineering, and Growth to name a few.
