## Google Analytics web traffic analysis

Web Traffic Analysis helps to gain insights about visitors and their behavior on our websites to deliver better results. BigQuery and Google Analytics provide you the information needed to improve the website, and make it the best it can be.

**The following subdomains are included:**
- about.gitlab.com _(primary for marketing analysis)_
- docs.gitlab.com
- forum.gitlab.com
- customers.gitlab.com
- learn.gitlab.com

### Why is BigQuery data used to analyze Google Analytics Data?
- No more sampled data
- Unlimited amount of dimensions
- Combining different scopes in one report _(e.g.: session with hit)_
- Build custom Channel Grouping and correct data errors
- Combine Google Analytics data with third party data sources _(e.g.: trial pageviews with trial campaign members in Salesforce)_

### Data Caveats and Constraints
- Number of users (Nbr of users) will always have approx 0.1-0.2% discrepancy between BigQuery and Google Analytics 360 UI. This is because Google Analytics shows an approximation for users, Big Query is exact.
- When reporting on hit level data (e.g.: pageviews), you need to link `google_analytics_360.session_hit` table to `analytics.ga360_session_xf` in order to filter by session_date, as there it is currently not available on hit level data (this is WIP in [this (internal link)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/7098) issue)

### Data Security Classification 

Google Analytics stores unique identifiers such as client id, visitor id that requires **ORANGE** classification

### Key Terms

- **Session** (aka visits): a group of user interactions with the website that take place within a given time frame. For example a single session can contain multiple page views, events, social interactions. The session expires at midnight and after a certain time of inactivity, that is **60 minutes** on GitLab subdomains.
- **Pageviews**: the number of times users view a page that has the Google Analytics tracking code inserted. This covers all page views; so if a user refreshes the page, or navigates away from the page and returns, these are all counted as additional page views.
- **Unique Pageviews**: The number of unique pageviews is calculated by counting a page viewed multiple times by the same user during the same session only one time. 
- **New Visitors**: New visitors/users are those users that have not visited your site before the time period specified
- **Returning Visitors**: Returning visitors/users made at least one visit to at least one page on the site previously. This is determined by whether Google Analytics can detect cookies, which indicate previous visits. If Google cannot detect a cookie one will be set for future recording, unless the user has disabled cookies in their personal browser preferences.
- **Bounce Rate**: it is given as a percentage and represents the number of visits when users leave the site after just one page; regardless of how they got to the site or how long they stayed on that page.
- **Hits**: interactions during a visit, including pageviews, events, and transactions
- **Events**: events help you measure activity that may not otherwise be recorded by the tracking code; these may include when a user plays a video, click on CTA etc.
- **Custom dimensions**: they enable you to record additional, non-standard data in Google Analytics, such as blog post tag, blog post type (author of blog post), etc

### Key Metrics, KPIs, and PIs

- **Sessions**: in order to properly query and match BigQuery web traffic data in Sisense with Google Analytics UI, you need to create a session id that overrides the midnight split: `CONCAT(visitor_id, CAST(visit_start_time AS STRING)`
- **Users**: calculating users should be based on visitor_id `COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id)`. Google Analytics takes all rows into account while calculating users (unlike sessions)
- **New Users**: calculating users should be based on visitor_id `COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id)` where `TOTAL_NEW_VISITS IS NOT NULL`
- **Pageviews**: this metric is based on hit level data and every row should be counted `COUNT(1)` where `HIT_TYPE = 'PAGE'`
- **Unique pageviews**: this metric is also based on hit level data, and in order to count the unique pageviews within a session, you have to concatenate the session id (explained in the _Sessions KPI_) with `PAGE_PATH` where `HIT_TYPE = 'PAGE'`. The results for all pages might have approx. -0.2% difference compared to Google Analytics UI.
- **Bounce rate**: `coming soon`


#### Key Fields and Business Logic
- `session_date`: every report including date dimension should be based on `session_date` instead of `visit_start_time`
- `visitor_id`: used to create session id and to calculate users
- `total_visits`: the number of sessions. This value is `1` for sessions with interaction events. The value is `null` if there are no interaction events in the session. Google Analytics shows interactive sessions only, this should be considered while querying nbr of sessions
- `hit_type`: type of the hit that can be `PAGE` or `EVENT`
- `page_path`: URL path of the page, _e.g.: /free-trial/_
- `host_name`: this is used to filter by the different subdomains _(about.gitlab.com, docs.gitlab.com, etc)_

#### Reference SQL

The below SQL queries define the calculation of each main metric that is matching with Google Analytics UI results (All Data - Raw No Filters view)

**Nbr of sessions, users and new users by day in Sept 2020**

```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day',session_date)::date                                                              AS visit_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT IFF(total_visits=1, CONCAT(visitor_id, CAST(visit_start_time AS STRING)), NULL))   AS interactive_Sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id)                                                                        AS users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT IFF(total_new_visits IS NOT NULL, visitor_id, NULL))                               AS new_users
FROM LEGACY.GA360_SESSION_XF
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day',session_date)::date >= '09/01/2020'
  AND DATE_TRUNC('day',session_date)::date <= '09/30/2020'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
**Nbr of total and trial pageviews by day from Feb 2020**

```sql

-- this subquery is needed in order to get the session_date for each unique session_id and link it to the hit level table
WITH ga_unique_sessions AS ( 

SELECT
 DISTINCT(CONCAT(visitor_id, CAST(visit_start_time AS STRING))) AS session_id,
 SESSION_DATE
FROM LEGACY.GA360_SESSION_XF 

-- total and trial pageview hits
), ga_pageview_hits AS ( 
  
SELECT
 CONCAT(visitor_id, CAST(visit_start_time AS STRING))           AS session_id,

 CASE
  WHEN page_path = '/free-trial/'
    THEN COUNT(1)
  ELSE 0
 END                                                            AS trial_pageviews,
 COUNT(1)                                                       AS total_pageviews
FROM LEGACY.GA360_SESSION_HIT
WHERE HIT_TYPE = 'PAGE'
GROUP BY 1,2
  
), final AS(
  
SELECT
 SESSION_DATE                                                   AS visit_date,
 SUM(trial_pageviews)                                           AS trial_pageviews,
 SUM(total_pageviews)                                           AS total_pageviews,
 COUNT(DISTINCT ga_pageview_hits.session_id,page_path )         AS unique_pageviews
FROM ga_pageview_hits
LEFT JOIN ga_unique_sessions
 ON ga_pageview_hits.session_id=ga_unique_sessions.session_id
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day',SESSION_DATE)::date >= '2/1/2020'
GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT *
FROM final

### Data Lineage

Google Analytics 360/ BigQuery data is based on `All Data - Raw No Filters` view that is using `(GTM-08:00) Los Angeles` Time zone. Google Analytics 360/BigQuery data is available from `19th Feb 2020` in Sisense. These are essential to know this while comparing your query results with Google Analytics 360 UI.

Each row in the Google Analytics BigQuery represents a single session.
There are a lot of dimensions and metrics on Google Analytics UI, this schema can be a bit overwhelming on database level. The below picture represents 2 sessions that helps to get a better understanding of the BigQuery data structure:

To get more clarity about BigQuery export schema, take a look at the below interactive tree map:

[*Source*](https://rpubs.com/Phippsy/bq-export)


There are **3 major BigQuery tables** that are crucial to perform web traffic analysis:

1. [analytics.ga360_session_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.ga360_session_xf): session level data that is used to calculate nbr of sessions, users, unique visitors
1. [google_analytics_360.session_hit](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/source/source.gitlab_snowflake.google_analytics_360.session_hit): hit level data to calculate pageviews, events, etc
1. [ga360_session_custom_dimension_xf](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.ga360_session_custom_dimension_xf): for reporting on GitLab specific dimensions (this depends on the scope defined for each custom dimension, more info [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709828?hl=en))
