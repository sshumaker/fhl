<h1 id="headerformat">Available to Renew: High-Level Concept </h1>
In a subscription business, it is crucial to understand what and how much of our subscription revenue is available to renew at a given time. This is important to understand cash flow and predict future earnings. 

<br>To calculate the amount of revenue available to renew at a given time, you must first filter your transactions to only recurring charges (i.e. subscriptions, not one-time deals). You must then determine when this subscription is set to renew based on its effective date. From these details you can get a broad view of how much revenue is available to renew at any given time. 

Additionally, to get the full picture of what is available to renew you must also determine if a subscription is a multi-year deal. If it is a multi-year deal, the subscription will be available to renew at the end of the multi-year term.

The models mentioned below have been designed to do this, pulling together the universe of potential renewal subscriptions at a point in time. The snapshotting models go further to lock in this data on a given date so we can review how the subscriptions available to renew shift over time compared to the live model.

By using historical data, you can then put weights on the amount of money available to renew to do forecasting for future billings or bookings. This model does not fall under the purview of the Data Team, but is an interesting use case for this particular model.

<h1 id="headerformat">Getting Started with the Data</h1>

To get started we want to make sure you understand:

* What KPIs/PIs are supported using this data model
* Key terms that will explain how we account for the metrics
* The data source behind the dashboard
* To explore further, you can create visual and analysis yourself in Sisense. A great way to start is using the Sisense Discovery tool.
* To go even deeper, you can explore data in snowflake. The benefit of exploring in Snowflake is you can join to additional information (i.e. other data sources).

<h1 id="headerformat">Understanding the Data Sources and Data Models</h1>

We want to make sure you understand:

* What models are available to use to analyze ATR
* The method for snapshotting ATR
* What these data models derive from (lineage)
* Example queries to get you started exploring the data

## Available to Renew

The base for all ATR reporting based on the live data in Zuora and Salesforce. You are able to slice the revenue available to renew by date dimensions, characteristics of a subscription (type, product, etc.), user attributes (geo, region, etc.), or account dimensions which will all reflect the current state of the corresponding objects in the source UI.

This model should be used to analyze what is available to renew right now for upcoming renewal months and to understand what is left on the table from previous renewal months that did not renew or did not have a linked renewal subscription.

#### Live Models
* `mart_available_to_renew`: Model showing subscriptions available to renew based on current data pulled from Zuora and Salesforce. This is live data and will update when changes are made in the source systems.

## Snapshot Available to Renew
ATR in the Zuora and Salesforce data changes on a daily basis as subscriptions are renewed and amended and opportunities are updated. Due to this fluctuation, it is necessary to create a snapshot of the data each day so we can have a historical record of ATR in the data warehouse to use for reporting and analysis. For ATR, we chose to use the simplest snapshotting method we have in our toolbox, explained below. Future iterations may include creating a "bottoms up" method involving snapshotted versions of all the base facts and dimensions involved in the ATR calculation, but this will be left for a future date as the business need arises.

#### Snapshot Method: 

We use [dbt snapshots](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/snapshots) which implement type-2 Slowly Changing Dimensions over mutable source tables. These Slowly Changing Dimensions (or SCDs) identify how a row in a table changes over time. In this method, called "Method One" by the Data Team, we snapshot the [`mart_available_to_renew`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.mart_available_to_renew) table which is the mart used to generate our live ATR metrics. This method produces an exact replica of `mart_available_to_renew` each day which is then modeled using [date spine techniques](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/building-models-on-top-of-snapshots/517). In this method, we do not use the snapshotted raw data and instead snapshot the mart table. We found this has benefits of producing a simple model of the snapshotted live ATR table that always stays up to date with the columns in the `mart_available_to_renew` without having to do full refreshes. This is a great fit for the use case of needing an exact `three ring binder` copy of `mart_available_to_renew` that keeps up with the columns and does not need to be fully refreshed. Even if the model is fully refreshed, it would still return the same results all of the time, ensuring long-term data integrity for financial reporting.

#### Snapshot Models
* `mart_available_to_renew_snapshot_model`: Using Method One described above, this is a daily snapshot of `mart_available_to_renew`, expanded using a date spine from the slowly changing dimension created by dbt. Use this model to see how ATR changes on a daily basis.
* `rpt_available_to_renew_snapshot_8th_calendar_day`: This model filters `mart_available_to_renew_snapshot_model` to the 8th calendar day of a snapshot month. This is used in financial reporting to represent what the state of ATR was after month-end-close.
* `rpt_available_to_renew_snapshot_45th_calendar_day`: This model filters `mart_available_to_renew_snapshot_model` to the 45th calendar day of a snapshot month. This model is an experiment to see how ATR continues to shift in the 45 days after month-end-close.
