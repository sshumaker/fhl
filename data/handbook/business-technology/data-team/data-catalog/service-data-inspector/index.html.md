## Service Data Inspector
[**Service Data Inspector**](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-dashboard/924978/ML-Draft:-Paying-Account---Service-Data-Inspector) provides a comprehensive view into all active paying CRM accounts and their corresponding subscriptions, licenses/namespaces and service pings for Self-Managed and SaaS customers. JiHu accounts are not included in this data. This dashboard is intended to support the following major use cases:

- Review all available Service Usage Data for all Paying Accounts
- Inspection of the Service Data and Service Data-related Salesforce and Zuora data for a single account
- Data Quality Review of Product Usage Data Quality Issues for Gainsight
- The dashboard is 100% supported by Trusted Data Models and is based on the same models used by:
  - Gainsight
  - Sales Funnel Reports

### Layout of the Dashboard:
The dashboard is divided into 3 sections aligned with the major subject areas presented:
Section 1: Overview contains top-level metrics to quickly orient
Section 2: Subscription Reports contains drill-down into Zuora subscription information
Section 3: Service Data Reports contains summary and detailed data tables from mart_product_usage_paid_user_metrics_monthly
