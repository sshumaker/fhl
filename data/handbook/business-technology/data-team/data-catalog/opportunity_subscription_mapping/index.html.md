The goal of this page:

* Help you understand the backfill of opportunity-subscription mapping
* Help you understand the reliability of this mapping
* And overall help everyone contribute!

## Opportunity-Subscription Mapping
The mapping between opportunities and subscriptions unlocks the quote to cash process for Go To Market Analytics including financial, marketing, and sales analytics. 

Historically this was not tracked in our source systems and needed to be backfilled based on our knowledge of previous processes. 

## Mapping Process

[Flow Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e7661694-61ed-4317-b648-d054be9aff0e/edit?viewport_loc=-76%2C340%2C3590%2C1767%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_f50ea2e1-1ea8-47ca-b950-75b723273b00)


## Data Quality
The backfill mapping process has been performed for all subscriptions created after 2019-02-01. Before this point, the processes were not robust enough to create logic for the mapping. We believe the mapping processes has produced a hierarchy of opportunity-subscription mappings, as follows:

- 2021-04-12 - Present: Green - Due to the internal processes created by Enterprise Apps, we are confident in the data created on or after 2021-04-12. A recent bug has been identified for a small subset of Web Direct deals, but this is a small (< 3%) subset of the overall subscription population. The above mapping has been applied for the blank subscriptions found on or after 2021-04-12 while this is fixed in the source.
- 2019-02-01 - 2021-04-11: Yellow - The above mapping has been applied for this time range. We believe this is directionally correct based on testing, but cannot assure full fidelity.
- Beginning of Time - 2019-01-31: Red - No mapping has been applied to this data and it is known to be unreliable.

Additionally, we have created a flag in `dim_subscription` to call out the data which is considered likely to have data quality issues. This is based on the backfill logic explained above. If an opportunity has been filled in based soley on `opportunity_term` or `subscription_name`, it has a higher likelyhood of being bad data, so we have created the `is_bad_mapping` flag to call out those opportunity-subscription connections which are made on loose assumptions.

## Data Quality Issue Remediation
If you observe a problem in the opportunity-subscription, open an [intake issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) with Enterprise Apps to correct the opportunity id on the subscription.
