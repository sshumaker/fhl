## Sales Funnel

The Sales Funnel is a core component of GitLab's Lead to Cash process and it tracks an inquiry from a potential customer all the way to a closed won opportunity. Along the way, a customer passes from a lead, to a marketing qualified lead, to a sales accepted opportunity, and finally to a closed won or lost opportunity. This handbook page provides analytical tools and resources to help GitLab team members analyze the entire sales funnel and generate insights. 

The goal of this page:

* Help you understand how to navigate through the [TD: Sales Funnel - Target vs. Actual Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/761665/TD:-Sales-Funnel---Target-vs.-Actual) and its derived dashboards.
* Help you understand the data models used to create the TD: Sales Funnel - Targets vs. Actuals Dashboard.
* Have you assess your understanding by taking a certification most applicable to your role at GitLab.
    * To learn more about how to use the dashboard, take the [Dashboard user certification](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTU4iVXI0yw0QSDjZbznbIMmhZSs1GxCoTsVOlg1lQdgUSGg/viewform).
    * To learn more about developing Sisense dashboards, take the [Dashboard Developer certification](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWz4VNYM5ItjzmgeU6H3hafY_zycd2NkAlAM4sPXJCqrtoUw/viewform).
* And overall help everyone contribute!

<h1 id="headerformat">Getting Started </h1>

To get started we want to make sure you understand:

* What KPIs/PIs are supported using this dashboard
* Key terms that will explain how we account for the metrics
* The data source behind the dashboard
* To explore further, you can create visual and analysis yourself in Sisense. A great way to start is using the Sisense Discovery tool. Want to get started in Sisense head here.
* To go even deeper, you can explore data in snowflake. The benefit of exploring in Snowflake is you can join to additional information (i.e. other data sources). Additional information on exploring in Snowflake can be found here.

  Key Metrics, KPIs, and PIs
</summary>
Facts:

* **Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL):** Count of qualified leads that could become a sales opportunity. Today a person can MQL once, but in the future, a MQL can qualify multiple times as we nurture contacts. A MQL is a lead that has reached a certain threshold, we have determined to be 100 points accumulated, based on demographic/firmographic and/or behavioral information. The "MQL score" is comprised of various actions and/or profile data that are weighted with positive or negative point values. Every time a Person Score is updated, LeanData will run a check to see if the record needs to be processed through the flow.
* **Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO):** An Opportunity that has a meeting set with a contact at a prospect who has authority to buy, or an initiative where GitLab can be the solution, or a fit that includes a use case and potential number of seats and a next step in the next 60 days. This opportunity has been validated and accepted by a sales rep that was generated by SDR.
* **SAO/MQL:** Snapshotted conversion rate of all MQLs that convert to SAOs in a month. Divide number of SAOs in a month by the number of MQLs in a month.
* **New Logos:** The number of first order accounts that we acquire.
* **Closed Won IACV (Net_ARR):** Bookings revenue for closed won deals.
* **Closed Won Deals:** The number of opportunities that have converted into revenue.
* **Win Rate:** Of the opportunities that get to resolution, how many do we win in a period.
* **ASP on New First Order Deals:** Average deal size of first order deals.
* **IACV (Net_ARR) Created:** The value of pipeline that was created on each day. Pipeline can change over time. This is the current pipeline based on creation date.
* **Cycle Time, SAO to Closed Won Deal:** Time it takes on average for an opportunity to reach conclusion for Closed Won deals.
* **SAO to Closed Won Conversion Rate:** Conversion rate of SAOs that convert to Closed Won deals on a monthly basis.
* **SAO to Closed Won - Closed Buckets:** Count of SAOs based on time it takes for SAO to reach conclusion for Closed Won deals.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown='span'>
  Key Fields and Business Logic
</summary>
* There are three critical dates on opportunities to be aware of: created date, accepted date, and closed date. Created date is applicable when calculating the IACV created metrics. Accepted date is applicable when calculating the Sales Accepted Opportunity Metrics (SAOs). Closed date is applicable when calculating the closed won and lost related metrics. 
* GitLab does not have a specific trial tier for the Gold and Ultimate trials; however, it is helpful to think about trials in the context of product tiers when building the Enterprise Dimensional Model (EDM) and producing insights and analytics from the EDM. We use Ultimate - Trial and Gold - Trial values in our Product Tier Dimension to be able to easily report on and analyze trials across the Enterprise.
* Boolean flags are available to use in Sisense. These are helpful when creating charts that require repetitive filters.
1. `is_net_arr_closed_deal` - Calculate metrics such as Net_ARR from Closed Won and Closed Lost-Renewals.
1. `is_new_logo_first_order` - Calculate metrics such as Net_ARR from First Order Accounts that we acquire.
1. `is_net_arr_pipeline_created` - Calculate metrics such as Net_ARR from the pipeline that was created.
1. `is_win_rate_calc` - Fetch opportunities in scope for the win rate calculation.
1. `is_closed_won` -  Calculate metrics such as Net_ARR for Closed Won deals.

<h1 id="headerformat">Understanding the Data Sources and Data Models</h1>
<br>
**TD: Sales Funnel - Target vs. Actual Dashboard** is created off report views generated from 3 primary mart views in Sisense, **[mart_crm_opportunity]**, **[mart_crm_person]**, and **[mart_sales_funnel_target]**. Sisense views allow us to reference a simple string of sql in as many charts as we want. This helps to take the guess work out for an end user in understanding logic behind calculations like New Logo Counts, or number of Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAOs) counts, and also takes the guesswork out of understanding which joins are possible.

To create your own dashboards, you can reference the following views available in Sisense:
* **[mart_crm_opportunity]** - mart table that joins the applicable facts and dimensions together to get a view of the opportunity section of the Sales Funnel.
* **[mart_crm_person]** - mart table that joins applicable facts and dimensions together to get a view of the marketing qualified lead section of the Sales Funnel.
* **[mart_sales_funnel_target]** - mart table that joins applicable facts and dimensions together to get a view of the Sales Funnel Targets.
* **[rpt_crm_opportunity_closed_period]** - report that pivots the **[mart_crm_opportunity]** view on the closed period and generaties useful date aggreation fields.
* **[rpt_crm_opportunity_accepted_period]** - report that pivots the **[mart_crm_opportunity]** view on the accepted period and generaties useful date aggreation fields.
* **[rpt_crm_opportunity_created_period]** - report that pivots the **[mart_crm_opportunity]** view on the created period and generaties useful date aggreation fields.
* **[rpt_sales_funnel_target]** - report that pivots the **[mart_sales_funnel_target]** view on the target period and generaties useful date aggreation fields. 
* **[rpt_crm_person_mql]** - report that filters **[mart_crm_person]** WHERE is_mql = 1 that is used to count MQLs.

This views takes into account the data models as seen in the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):

  Sales Funnel Management View - Preloaded Cuts
</summary>

The [TD: Sales Funnel Management View - Preloaded Cuts](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/828239/TD:-Sales-Funnel-Management-View---Preloaded-Cuts) dashboard tracks the main 9 KPIs from the Sales Funnel:

1. Net ARR
1. New Logos
1. Pipeline Created
1. Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAO)
1. Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)
1. Trials
1. Average Sales Price (ASP)
1. MQLs to SAOs
1. Win Rate

The KPIs are compared to their respective targets at a quarter to date (QTD) pacing, slicing them by different dimensions. These cuts allow management to get a quick high level overview on how the business is performing across different dimensions. It answers the question of what areas of the business are on track and which need more attention.

Currently, the sales management cuts are powered by the following snippets (instructions on how to use them are in the description section of the snippet):

1. [main_qtd_view_sales_funnel](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/snippet/main_qtd_view_sales_funnel/55d49d17d8cf4cc6bf976c61da2d0017/edit)
1. [ratio_qtd_view_sales_funnel](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/snippet/ratio_qtd_view_sales_funnel/55d5211e130f45a29a3a1562307f95d9/edit)

The [sales management python module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/periscope/-/tree/periscope/master/custom_modules/sales_management), along with the snippets, are used to visualize the reports in the BI layer.

  Standard Bookings Cuts
</summary>

The [TD: Standard Bookings Cuts](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/831911/TD:-Standard-Bookings-Cuts) dashboard tracks the performance of Booked Net ARR against the Previous Year (Year over Year, Y/Y) and against the quarterly and yearly financial target by different dimensions.

Each cut is composed of a Quarter View and a Fiscal Year View.

To use the dashboard select a Fiscal Quarter in the filters and any of the options of the `Drilldown` filter. The latter selects the granularity of the `Sales Segment Drilldown` field:

| Overall | Large - PubSec Breakdown | Large - Region Breakdown | Mid-Market Breakdown |
|     --         | --           | --              | --                |

  Data Security Classification
</summary>
Much of the data within and supporting Sales Funnel Analysis is [Orange](/handbook/security/data-classification-standard.html#orange) or [Yellow](/handbook/security/data-classification-standard.html#yellow). This includes ORANGE customer metadata from the account and GitLab's Non public financial information, all of which shouldn't be publicly available. Care should be taken when sharing data from this dashboard to ensure that the detail stays within GitLab as an organization and that appropriate approvals are given for any external sharing. In addition, when working with row or record level customer metadata care should always be taken to avoid saving any data on personal devices or laptops. This data should remain in [Snowflake](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#data-warehouse) and [Sisense](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/sisensecdt/) and should ideally be shared only through those applications unless otherwise approved.

**ORANGE**

- Description: Customer and Personal data at the row or record level.

  - `dim_crm_account`

**YELLOW**
