# <i class="fas fa-users" id="biz-tech-icons"></i> Who We Are


The **Enterprise Applications Team** implements and supports specialized applications that support our business processes within GitLab.

We are directly responsible for all of GitLab's finance systems and Enterprise Applications Integrations.  We build and extend these applications to support the processes of our business partners and rationalize our application landscape to ensure it is optimized for efficiency and spend.

Our team ensures the availability of these applications and integrations through monitoring and alerting. These internal-facing applications include a multitude of different applications and environments, including Zuora, Adaptive Planning, Netsuite, Expensify, etc.  We are also responsible for the IT Audit and Compliance function to ensure we pass SOX Audit for our IT General Controls (ITGC).

Our Enterprise Applications team is made up of a combination of roles to best support the services we offer. Learn more about each by clicking on the tiles:

## Intake Request

Before opening a new intake request with Enterprise Applications, please check the [Services We Support]() section that lists the templates to be used for specific requests.
{: .alert .alert-danger}

To request work to be added to the [Enterprise Applications Roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/-/roadmap?state=opened&sort=start_date_asc&layout=WEEKS&timeframe_range_type=CURRENT_QUARTER&label_name%5B%5D=BT-Project&progress=WEIGHT&show_progress=true&show_milestones=false&milestones_type=ALL), please open an [intake issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=#) using the “Request” template.

Every week, the Enterprise Applications Leadership reviews the [EntApps Intake board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/boards/2798638?label_name%5B%5D=EntApps%20Intake) and there are only 2 possible outputs for the issues on the _Open_ list:

- The issue is ready to be worked on and so it will be added to a milestone.
   - Enterprise Applications Leadership is responsible for removing the label _EntApps Intake_, adding the correct team label (~"BSA", ~"BT Finance Systems or ~"BT Integrations::Backlog") and appropriated milestone following the [Milestone Planning]() process.
   - Additional information might be requested in the issue.
   - Once requirements are defined by the ~"BSA" team, associated system changes will be sent to the ~"BT Finance Systems team in the form of a [Change Management Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/new) for configuration.
- The issue is not ready to be picked up and will be added to the [EntApps Backlog board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/4710080?label_name[]=BT%3A%3ABacklog).
   - Enterprise Applications Leadership is responsible for adding the ~"BT::Backlog" label and removing ~"EntApps Intake" as well as adding a justification in the issue as a comment.

## Backlog
The [EntApps Backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/4710080?label_name[]=BT%3A%3ABacklog) board is used by the EntApps team to review and act on Backlog requests. The Enterprise Applications Leadership reviews the board every 2 weeks, before a new milestone starts.

The EntApps Backlog board has 2 lists:
- The `BT Backlog` list is dedicated to issues that are **not yet ready** to start.
   - When a backlog issue is ready to be worked on, Enterprise Applications Leadership will remove the ~"BT::Backlog" label and add the ~"EntApps Intake" so it will be included in the weekly review of the [EntApps Intake](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/boards/2798638?label_name%5B%5D=EntApps%20Intake) board.
- The `Closed` list works as a history of all the issues that did not progress and so were closed.
   - It is the responsibility of the requestor to be clear on what the scope of their issue is. Issues that are in the backlog for 30 days without engagement from the requestor will be closed. If the issue needs to be picked back up, the requestor must re-open it and manually add the ~"EntApps Intake" label.
   - If the issue is in the backlog because it is blocked, the ~"BT::Blocked" label must be added to keep the issue open for longer than 30 days.

Both [EntApps Intake](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/boards/2798638?label_name%5B%5D=EntApps%20Intake) and [EntApps Backlog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/4710080?label_name[]=BT%3A%3ABacklog) boards are at gitlab.com level so that issues created in other team's projects can appear on the board.
The _~"EntApps Intake"_ label is not limited to the Intake project, it can be used in different issues across all gitlab.com.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

## EntApps Milestone Planning

EntApps milestones run for 2 weeks from Wednesday-Tuesday to avoid pushing changes over the weekend. This is also in line with the [Business Technology blocked periods](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/change-management/#procedure) and the GitLab calendar.

Every Tuesday, Enterprise Applications Leadership is responsible for:
- Reviewing the [EntApps Intake board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/boards/2798638?label_name%5B%5D=EntApps%20Intake) and:
   - Add a milestone to every intake issue that is ready to be worked on.
      - The [Enterprise Applications Portfolio Management tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GLer7B_2egKnJH5tcZ5ZxGQtyPcZeOrLRhk7SvqMrQ/edit#gid=613831191) and the [Project Weights](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/#project-weights) will be used to help understand the team capacity.
- Reviewing the current milestone dashboard to monitor issues and re-prioritize / update milestones as needed.

#### Considerations
Once the Enterprise Applications Leadership creates the first version of an upcoming milestone, before the milestone begins, input from BSA, FinSys and Integrations team members is required (sync or async) in order to:
1. Assign every issue to the correct team and team member.
2. Add an [issue weight](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/#issue-weights). The goal is to go over the problem statement raised in the issue with the team that will be working on it and put it into one of 5 buckets: XS, S, M, L, XL as a way to group the unit of work.
   - The issue can be broken down into smaller issues (less weights) as needed. 
2. Add the appropriated [priority label](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/#issue-labels) to every issue in the milestone.

### EntApps Milestone Timing

EntApps milestones run for 2 weeks meaning that a request that comes when a milestone is already ongoing, will be placed in the queue and follow the [Intake process](). If your request is urgent, please open an [intake issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/intake/-/issues) and tag @jesssalcido and @broncato in a comment. Enterprise Applications Leadership will work with the requestor to prioritize it and place it in the appropriated milestone.

### Issue Weights
Issue weight is an estimate of how much time is required to complete the request from an issue, using the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Fibonacci-sequence). 

| Size | Dedicated Person Time | Weight (issue points) | Description / Examples |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| XS | 4 hours / Half Day | 1 | A task. The simplest possible change. We are confident there will be no side effects, and interaction with stakeholders is minimal. <br><br> **Example:** <br>- Update existing handbook page/documentation. <br> - Deprecation of an [unused Hosted Payment Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/515) in Zuora. |
| S | 1 Day | 2-3 | The problem statement has been determined and a solution identified. No need for (extra) discussion with other teams.<br><br> **Example:** <br>- Modification of [Reason Codes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/768) in Zuora. <br>- [Update CSS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/738) for Zuora Hosted Payment Page (affects self-service, requires testing and interfacing with engineering department). |
| M | 1 Week | 5 | The problem statement has been defined with understood requirements. Extra investigation is required but the expectation is that once a solution is identified, it should be relatively easy to implement.<br><br> **Example:** <br>- Most system bugs or performance issues.<br> - [Stripe Account for Boundless / BigCommerce](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/725)|
| L | 2-3 Weeks | 8 | The problem statement has been defined but a solution will require extra investigation in order to be identified and implemented. Surprises are expected, different teams will have to be involved. Significant investigation will be required and once the problem is found, a solution may not be straightforward.<br><br> **Example:** <br> - Bugs or system workflows that negatively impact the work of other people.<br> - [Stripe V2 Implementation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/finance-systems/-/issues/462) |
| XL | > 4 weeks | 13 | The problem statement has been defined but it's a significant change that has dependencies and the requirements are probably not fully understood or known. It's unlikely we would resolve this in just one issue and the preference would be to further clarify requirements and/or break into smaller issues. <br><br> **Example:** <br>- A new system or module implementation.<br> - [E-Disty Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/business-technology/enterprise-apps/financeops/-/epics/16), which involves multiple changes, and has been broken down into smaller issues. |


<div class="panel panel-warning">
**Consideration**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">

For issues that are added to a milestone with [8+ points/weights](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/#issue-weights), the expectation is that by the end of the 2 weeks milestone, the problem statement has been defined but a solution might require extra investigation in order to be identified and implemented. Surprises are expected, different teams might have to be involved and so the issue will be carried over to the following milestone.

### Project Weights
Following an activity-based estimate, beginning with the requirements of the project and the size of the application and then, based on this information, defining the required tasks, which will serve to identify the overall effort that will be required.
