    participant Z as Zuora
    participant W as Workato
    participant P as GCP Pub/Sub
    participant N as Netsuite

    end
end

W ->> P: Fetch job
activate W
P -->> W: Job Payload
W ->> N: Fetch metadata accounts subsidiaries etc
N -->> W: Data
W ->> N: Create Journal Entry
N -->> W: Journal Entry Id
W ->> Z: Mark Journal Entry as Transferred

```

# Error handling

1. If journal entries are invalid, they are immediately put into the dead letter queue.
1. When journal entries fail to sync, the job in GCP Pub/Sub will be retried a few times and then put into the dead letter queue if it continues to fail.

# Security Components
All API calls are authenticated using API credentials which have been granted only the permissions needed for the integration to function. All connections are over HTTPS or SOAP using TLS encrypted connections.

# Data classification

This integration handles [Orange Data](/handbook/security/data-classification-standard.html#orange). The data is stored in the queue and processed by the system.

- In the future this integration should be moved into Nestjs to greatly simplify it.
