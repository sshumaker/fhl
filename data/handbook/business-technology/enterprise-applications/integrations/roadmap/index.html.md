# Integrations Roadmap
## Preamble
The Enterprise Applications Integrations team has spent the past ~3 Quarters establishing itself and establishing our processes. 
Our focus has now shifted towards designing a technical architecture and developing a roadmap for reaching our desired technical maturity.

We have spent the middle of Q1 researching and drawing inspiration from industry and domain knowledge developed by integrations companies and teams in order
to agree on a high-level architecture for an integrations platform.
This integrations platform will be designed to serve GitLab's Enterprise Applications ecosystem long into the future and assist us in consistently applying oustanding security, scalability, maintainability, reusability, and testing standards. It will also allow the Integrations Engineering team to provide reliable SLA's to our business partners and move quickly to implement new integrations and refactor existing integrations as GitLab's needs change in this high growth period for the company.
