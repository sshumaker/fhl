One of the team's initiatives has been to conduct short training sessions on different topics within the Enterprise Applications domain.

**Why we do this:**
* Increase the base level of system and process knowledge across the team
* Provide a more homogeneous level of support to our business partners on key topics
* Allow team members to self-service as much as possible and reduce disruptions for small tasks
