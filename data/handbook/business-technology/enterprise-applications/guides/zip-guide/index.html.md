### How to request a new vendor?

### How to do a request change?

1. Login to your [Okta home page.](https://gitlab.okta.com/app/UserHome)
2. Click on `+New Request` on the right side of the top menu.

6. Attach supporting documentation from the supplier for the change. This could be a SOW, Change Request, and/or Order Form based on the purchase type.
