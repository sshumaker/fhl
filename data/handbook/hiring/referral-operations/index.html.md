#### Adding a Referral to Workday (People Connect Team)

People Connect will review the following guidelines to ensure the correct amount is being awarded with the One Time Payment in Workday.

1. Ensure that the current team member is eligible for a referral based upon the [requirements](/handbook/hiring/referral-process/#referral-bonus-eligibility).
2. Review when the referral was submitted in Greenhouse
    * `Job` > `Application Review` > `Applied On YYYY-MMM-DD`
    * Our current referral bonus amounts as of **2022-06-01** are listed [here](/handbook/incentives/#referral-bonuses).
    * If the referral was submitted **on or before 2020-04-09**, then the following referral amounts apply:
        * $1,000 base referral bonus for a new hire.
        * $500 supplemental referral bonus for a hire from a Location factor less than 0.65.
        * $1,000 supplemental referral bonus for a hire from an underrepresented group.
    * If the referral was submitted **after 2020-04-10** and **before 2022-06-01**, then refer to the bonus amounts would have been:
        * $500 base referral bonus for a new hire.
        * $1,000 supplemental referral bonus for a hire from a Location factor less than 0.65.
        * $1,500 supplemental referral bonus for a hire from an underrepresented group. 
    * For candidates referred multiple times, the referral date is determined by the date the referral was submitted for the position the candidate ends up accepting.

#### Transferring Referral Submissions to Greenhouse

Per the current [Referral Submission Process](/handbook/hiring/referral-process/#submitting-a-referral), Team Members will submit referrals through Greenhouse if the vacancy is posted externally and via Issues if the vacancy is **only** open internally. When a new Issue appears, please do the following:

1. Assign the Issue to yourself (upper right corner).
    * _Reruiting Operations & Insights_ is responsible for assigning the appropriate _Sourcer(s)_.
        * The appropriate *Sourcer(s)* is determined by referencing the **Hiring Team** page of the requisition.
1. Check to make sure the Issue is marked as `Confidential`.
    * _Reruiting Operations & Insights_ will ensure this setting is enabled.
1. Check to see if the vacancy is posted on the external [Job Board](https://boards.greenhouse.io/gitlab/) and if it is, **tag** the *Referrer*, **comment** that they'll need to submit their referral directly in Greenhouse per [these instructions](/handbook/hiring/referral-process/#submitting-a-referral-in-greenhouse), and **close** the Issue.
    * _Reruiting Operations & Insights_ will check to make sure the vacancy is only posted internally.
1. If the vacancy is **only** open internally, go to your Greenhouse dashboard and click `+` > `Add a Referral`.
1. Reference the Issue to see what should be entered in the following fields:
    * **Job**

#### How to Respond to Referral Update Requests

Our Inbound Sourcing team runs point on responding to questions related to referrals in the #talent-acquisition slack channel and ensures that the referrer is credited as the source of a referred candidate.

The Talent Acquisition Team uses the [GitLab Service Desk](/stages-devops-lifecycle/service-desk/) to track incoming emails to the `referral@gitlab` email. These emails will, in turn, show up as `Issues`.

To set-up notifications for the [Referral Service Desk Project](https://gitlab.com/gl-talent-acquisition/referrals), please do the following:

1. Click on the `Bell` icon in the upper right corner (next to `Star` and `Clone`).
1. Go to `Custom Settings`.
1. Click `New Issue`.
1. Close the window.

To take action on Issues in that project:

1. Click `Issues` in the left menu bar.
    * This is where incoming `referral@` emails will be; any open Issues here will need to be addressed.
1. Click on the new `Issue`.
1. Assign it to yourself (upper right corner).
1. Read the Issue.
1. Add the appropriate label(s).
1. Look-up the candidate in Greenhouse, if applicable.
1. Respond to the Issue by commenting and please be sure to do so just as you would with any other GitLab communication.
    * e.g. *"Hi, NAME. Thank you for reaching out about the status of your referral. Per our [SLA](/handbook/hiring/referral-process/#referral-statuses), please allow us 5 business days to review the submission. `@RECRUITER` is responsible for this role and they’ll provide the candidate with an update soon."*
   * e.g. *"Thank you for the referral. `@RECRUITER` is responsible for this role and will provide you with an update soon."*
1. Please be sure to `@-mention` the responsible Recruiter so that they’re aware an update is being requested.
1. If one comment addresses the entirety of the message, comment and **close** the Issue. If further information is needed, comment and leave the Issue open.
1. The Recruiter will reassign the Issue to themselves once they pickup the communication. They may also add any applicable labels.
1. The Assignee will **close** the Issue when communication is complete.

#### Referral Roundup Sessions

Our Talent Acquisition Team occasionally organizes *Referral Roundup Sessions*.

The objective of theses sessions are to gather referrals, region-specific information about where you're based, and teach you skills related to sourcing and Greenhouse.

Each session will have a corresponding Issue linked and in that, we ask that you please add information regarding appropriate companies to source from, local meet-up groups, conferences, job boards to advertise on, and any other information you believe will be beneficial to our hiring efforts in your area.

A Talent Acquisition Team Member will attend these sessions, so they be able to address any questions that arise on sourcing, LinkedIn, or Greenhouse.

#### Referral Rejection Notifications

In the event that a *Referral* is rejected based on their location factor the following steps will need to be taken by the requisition's **Recruiter**:

1. Send the rejection email to the candidate via Greenhouse using the `Referral Declined - Not ELF` template.
1. Search for the **closed** referral submission Issue for the respective candidate and add the following comment:

> Thank you again for submitting `CANDIDATE_FIRST_NAME` to the `REQUISITION_TITLE` role.
>
> Unfortunately, we’re unable to move forward with `CANDIDATE_FIRST_NAME`’s candidacy right now because they are located in a higher location factor area. With our [outbound hiring model](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/candidate/faq/), the > Talent Acquisition team is focused on building a more diverse team in the most efficient way. This allows us to support our all-remote vision: to spread opportunity to underserved locales, and to influence the increase of wages for remote work outside of metro areas.
>
> `CANDIDATE_FIRST_NAME` has received an email from our team explaining this. We’ve also added some clarity about this in the [Referral Submission Issue Template](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/referral-process/#submitting-a-referral) now to be sure team members consider this before they submit their referral.
>
> We appreciate your understanding and hope you’ll continue to refer talented people to GitLab!

#### Ensuring Referral Confidentiality

Once a week, a Talent Acquisition Operations & Insights Team Member will check to make sure that all submitted referral Issues are marked as `Confidential`.

To do that, please take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://gitlab.com/gl-talent-acquisition/referrals/-/issues) section of the Referrals Project.
1. Clicked on `Closed` Issues.
1. Set the following filter: `Confidential = No` and run the search.
1. If any Issues appear, please edit the `Confidentiality` section in the right column.
