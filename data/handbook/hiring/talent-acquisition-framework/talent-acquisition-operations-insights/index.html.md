  </summary>

* **Candidate Profile Merge Requests**

  All of Talent Acquisition has access to merge profiles. If you have any questions, please contact the Enablement Manager because profile merges cannot be undone. You can merge candidate profiles by viewing the right hand toolbar on an applicant profile, and clicking on either the alert that appears at the top of the toolbar or `See More` in the `Tools`section. 

  Before beginning, please ensure that the profiles are a match for each other by verifying that their emails, phone numbers, and/or resumes are the same.  
  
  When selecting which profile is Primary, consider the following: 
   * As a rule of thumb, the most recent applicant profile should most likely be the Primary one, unless the most recent is a Prospect.
   * If this is an internal candidate, the most recent profile should always be Primary, but should not be merged until the candidate has accepted their offer to minimize the number of people with access to this information. 
   * After merging, check the Activity Feed and Details tabs to see what information was removed from old profiles and ensure that you have the most accurate Recruiter, Coordinator, and Source.
* **Offer Approvals**
    * The Offer Approvals process can be accessed in the [Greenhouse Handbook page](/handbook/hiring/greenhouse/#updating-requisition-and-offer-approval-flows)
* **Requisition Approvals**
    * To re-open a closed requisition and increase the opening count:
       1. Navigate to the *Approvals* tab, select `Edit Job & Openings`
       1. Navigate down to the *Openings* section and select `Add New`.
       1. Once a new opening populates, manually add the Opening ID number. The `Hiring Manager` section should mirror the other openings.
       1. Verify with the recruiter if the opening is a Backfill or New Hire. Select `Reopen as Draft`.
       1. Restart the approval process by selecting `Request Approval`. Mark a Total Rewards approver as approved. Send a note to Finance to review the additional opening request. Be sure to cc the recruiter in that note.
* **Referral Submissions**
    * [See how to process Referral Submissions in the handbook.](/handbook/hiring/referral-operations/#transferring-referral-submissions-to-greenhouse)
* **Troubleshooting Platform Errors and Issues**
    * If and when you encounter an error/issue with Greenhouse that you're unable to solve for, you can take one of two actions.
        1. Chat with their *Support Team* via their **Get Help** tool in the bottom-left corner of a page or...
        1. Submit a ticket to their *Support Team* via the same **Get Help** tool.
            * Alternatively, you can email `support@greenhouse.io`.
        * You'll have the option to choose one of the two aforementioned options.
#Creating and/or updating custom fields in Greenhouse
    * If and when you encounter a need to create a custom field or update an existing custom field for any reason:
        1. Submit an issue outlining the change needed and why.
        1. Assign the issue to the System Owner of Greenhouse as outlined on the [tech stack](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/tech_stack.yml)

  Sales Hiring Forecast Report
  </summary>

* **System**: Adaptive and Greenhouse
* **Greenhouse Reports**:
    * Job Status Report
    * Current Pipeline Per Job Report
* **Instructions**: Refresh the `[GH] Job Status - Open + Draft`, `[GH] Job Status - Draft`, `[GH] Req Status - Open + Draft`, and `[GH] Req Status - Draft` tabs and then copy and paste any *Draft* status requisitons to the respective tab titled, `... Open + Draft`. The proceed with each tab by doing the following:
    * Job Status Report (`[GH] Job Status - Open + Draft` tab)
        1. Move `GHP ID` to **Column A**.
        1. Insert a new column (**Column B**) and title it, `VLOOKUP`.
        1. Move `Opening Status` to **Columb C**.
        1. Set the formula in `VLOOKUP` as follows in the row below the column header: `=VLOOKUP(A9,'Forecast to Plan'!A:A,1,0)`.
            * Copy the formula down to include all rows that have data.
            * The following columns will need to be looked up manually:
                * `Hiring Manager`, `Sales VP`, `Recruiter`, and `NQR/OQR`
        1. Sort the data by `Opening Status` (A -> Z).
        1. Look for any `#N/A` results in the `VLOOKUP` column where the `Opening Status` = **Open** and add the respective `GHP ID` to the `Forecast to Plan` tab.
    * Current Pipeline Per Job Report (`[GH] Req Status - Open + Draft` tab)
        1. Duplicate the `Requisition ID` column and move it to **Column A** (the duplicate column will be in **Column C**).
        1. Insert a new column (**Column N**) and title it, `Req Status`
            * Working backwards (i.e. `Background Check and Offer` to `Get to Know Us`) provide a req status where there are **no** blanks or zero values in a column.
            * Provide one of the following statuses: *Not Opened Yet*, *Application Review*, *Screening*, *Hiring Manager Interview*, *Team Interview*, *References*, *Offer Pending*, or *Start Date Pending*.
    * `Forecast to Plan` Tab
        1. Where formulas are present, drag them down to cover all rows.
        1. The following rows will need to be entered manually: `Sales VP` (Column I), `Aligned Recruiter` (Column J), and `NQR/OQR` (Column K).
        1. Audit the sheet where `#N/A` appears in a column where a formula is present.
        1. If a formula is **not** working as expected, check the `Named ranges` on the sheet to see if something is amiss (`Data` > `Named ranges`).
            * For example, when updating the `[GH] Req Status - Open + Draft` tab, its `Named range` will need to be updated because `Requisition ID` is moved to Column A and that affects that range. Update it to include Column A and it'll work.
* **Adaptive Report**:
    * Finance will pull and export a report to the [FY22 Headcount Tracker (Hongker)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZIYG5YctfhXSR9iAq5l1WNSfpG4moeofMTgSbKD4Hl8/edit#gid=0) sheet.
    * Auditing `GHP IDs` in Adaptive that are **not** in Greenhouse
        1. Go to the `GitLab Hiring Plan` tab.
        1. Insert a new column (**Column B**) and title it, `Opened?`.
        1. Set the formula in `Opened` as follows in the row below the column header: `=VLOOKUP(A5,NEWjobstatus,1,0)`.
            * If the `GHP ID` matches, it exists.
            * If the cell produces a `#N/A`, it doesn't exist.
            * To note, there are situations where the requisition has closed, but it has yet to fall off the Adaptive report. In such a situation, please ping the *Recruiting Manager* for Sales.
    * Auditing `GHP IDs` in Greenhouse that are **not** in Adaptive
        1. Go to the `[GH] Job Status - Open + Draft` tab.
        1. Insert a new column at the end (**Column U**) and title it, `Opened?`.
        1. Set the formula in `Opened` as follows in the row below the column header: `=VLOOKUP(A5,GHP,1,0)`.
            * If the `GHP ID` matches, it exists.
            * If the cell produces a `#N/A`, it doesn't exist.
