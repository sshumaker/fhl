1. Select the option to `Add to Another Job`.
1. Select the appropriate "Job" and "Stage" you want to transfer the candidate to > `Add to Job`.

### Reviewing Candidate Applications

**How to Access the Review Applications Feature in Greenhouse**

While only the assigned *Recruiter* has the `Applications to Review` widget on their Greenhouse dashboard, other `Job Admin` users can access that feature one of two ways. Those being:

1. By accessing a requisition's `Job Dashboard` tab and referencing the `Pipeline` box in the upper right-hand corner.
    * If there are candidates in the `Get to Know Us` stage, a green box will appear that reads, `Review Applications`.
    * Once inside that feature, you'll be presented with a overall view of the candidate's details and resume, if provided.
    * From this page, a candidate can either be `Advanced`, `Skipped`, or `Rejected` (upper right-hand corner).
    * Additionally, feedback can be left by clicking the `Leave Feedback` button.
1. By searching via the `All Jobs` tab and filtering to see how many new candidates there are to review.
    * To view only your requisitions, please set the following filters:
        * **Job Status** = `Open` AND...
        * **User** = `Me` AND...
        * **Role** = `Sourcer` 
    * The *Sourcer* can then see how many candidates are in the requisition, including how many are "New." To review applications, the user would then click into a requisition and click `Review Applications` to review the applications.
    * Alternatively, a *Sourcer* could click into the `Candidates` tab of a requisition, make sure that the following filters are set, and review applications that way.
        * **Status** = `Active` (Profile Details > Status)
        * **Job Status** = `Open` (Jobs > Filter by Job)
        * That the `Requisition Title` is selected
            * This will be auto-selected when accessed via a specific requisition
        * **Stage** is sorted `(early to late)`

### Candidate Profile Merge Requests

  All of Talent Acquisition has access to merge profiles with the exception of internal candidates, which must be done by a Site Admin. If you have any questions, please contact Enablement because profile merges cannot be undone. You can merge candidate profiles by viewing the right hand toolbar on an applicant profile, and clicking on either the alert that appears at the top of the toolbar or `See More` in the `Tools`section. 

  Before beginning, please ensure that the profiles are a match for each other by verifying that their emails, phone numbers, and/or resumes are the same.  
  
  When selecting which profile is Primary, consider the following: 
   * As a guideline, the most recent applicant profile should most likely be the Primary one, unless the most recent is a Prospect.
   * If this is an internal candidate, the most recent profile should always be Primary, but should not be merged until the candidate has accepted their offer to minimize the number of people with access to this information. Please ensure the internal applicant's email address is their GitLab one before asking Enablement to merge.
   * After merging, check the Activity Feed and Details tabs to see what information was removed from old profiles and ensure that you have the most accurate Recruiter, Coordinator, and Source.
