## Talent Acquisition Process - Candidate Experience Specialist Contract Processes
{: #framework-coord}

Assuming that the [hiring process](/handbook/hiring/) went smoothly, now it is time to prepare the applicable contracts. Once the verbal offer is made, an issue will be created via the "email team" option in Greenhouse. You should keep this issue open until you've hired the candidate into BambooHR. The coordinator will send the contract to the applicant, using DocuSign in Greenhouse. On rare occasion, the coordinator may have to create the contract outside of Greenhouse using Google Docs; if this is the case, the coordinator needs to have a manager review the contract for accuracy before sending it out for signature.

First, be sure to validate the following:

1. The candidate lives in a country we are able to hire in. The SSOT for all country hiring is [here](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/hiring_status/index).
1. The currency listed in the offer package in Greenhouse should normally be the local currency of the new team member unless they explicitly request USD/EUR because their local currency has a lot of inflation. This needs to be confirmed and approved by Total Rewards prior to making the offer, as any changes to the currency will require complete reapproval in Greenhouse, regardless if it is the same amount just in a different currency.
1. Confirm if the team member would be an employee or contractor and [through which entity the team member would be employed or contracted](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#team-member-types-at-gitlab). If the team member wants to be contracted through a company, it can either be their own established legal entity or a separate and unaffiliated 3rd party company; please confirm which with the team member prior to sending out the contract. If the team member will be contracted through their own entity (or as an independent contractor), please use the BV Contractor Agreement. If the team member will be contracted through a 3rd party company, please inform Legal so that we can enter into a vendor contract with the company. The 3rd party company will then enter into a contract with the team member, and People Ops Analyst will provide the necessary specific salary and position information.
1. If the candidate is located in _Belgium_ the CES or Recruiter should be aware of two further things to address: i. there are strict language/translation requirements in Belgium so the CES or Recruiter should cofirm which region of Belgium the candidate is located in and let legal know, to ensure the right contract, in the right language is used, and so that a translation can be arranged if necessary; and ii. if the role is _not_ Grade 9 or higher, the CES or Recruiter should send a link to the role and the job requisition to the legal team via the #legal Slack channel once the candidate is at offer stage (before anything is sent out!) to determine whether or not the role is a position of trust. 
1. The recruiter should select "Email the team" and send the "CES Start Contract Request" email to CES* to initiate the offer letter and background check processes after the verbal offer has been made.

#### Offer Details Access steps
Not all individuals who are signatories for entities have the appropriate access in Greenhouse and this is something that has to be set up on a per req basis at time of contract sending. 

Once the entity of the chosen candidate has been determined and the CES team has received the request to send the contract, follow the steps below: 
1. Go to the `Job Setup` tab within Greenhouse
1. Select `Edit` in the `Job Info` box at the top of the screen
1. Select the pencil icon next to `Office` and pick the correct entity 

### Send the contract through Greenhouse

1. Once the offer package has been approved in Greenhouse and the recruiter has given the verbal offer, go to the candidate's profile in Greenhouse. Verify the address is listed on the details tab. If the address is not listed you can locate it on the background check, or in the reference request email reply.
1. If necessary click Edit Profile to update the candidate's name to their legal name (given during the reference/background check stage) and list any preferred names in quotes as the first name. Legal names are required on contracts and for proper export to Bamboo HR.
1. Ensure the start date is on a Monday, unless Monday is a holiday/[no start date](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/people_connect_team/#people-connect-availability) or the non-Monday date is legally required.
1.  Update signatory and entity by clicking "Update" under Offer Details. Add signatory name and title, as well as entity based on candidate's location.
1. Next you'll need to update the signatory's permissions to ensure we're able to send the DocuSign contract to them.
    - Navigate to `Job Setup` at the top of the page.
    - Click `Hiring Team` on the left handside toolbar.
    - Navigate down to the search bar located underneath `Who can see this job?`
    - Search the signatory's name
    - Click the pencil to trigger the dropdown list of permissions
    - Select `Job Admin: Job Approver`
    - Click `Save`
    - Navigate back to the Offer Details on the candidate profile and continue next steps
1. Scroll to the section "Offer Documents" and click "Generate". Then click in the box and select from the options the appropriate template for the team member's entity, employment/contractor status, full-time or part-time, and any applicable bonuses. An example is `GitLab Inc full-time, with variable bonus/commission`. Then click "Generate". It will now populate and .docx and .pdf files under the "Offer Documents" section. Download the pdf and preview it to ensure everything populated correctly. If there are any token errors (i.e. problems with the information pulling from the candidate's profile and into the contract), Greenhouse will notify you. Most likely, if that happens it is because a field in the candidate profile is not accurately filled in. Once you fix the error, you'll need to "Regenerate" the contract.
    - GitLab BV Belgium contracts are classified as Sales/Non-Sales, With OTE/Without OTE, and Position of Trust/Not a Position of Trust. All roles that are Grade 9 or above should be given the appropriate "Position of Trust" contract. If the role is not Grade 9 or higher, send the job requisition to the legal team via the #legal slack channel to determine which contract should be used.  
1. Next, click "Send with DocuSign" right below the offer documents. You will need to have first connected your Greenhouse account with your DocuSign account by going to the integrations tab in Greenhouse.
1. Choose the correct template according to country, or if no country template is available select `Offer through DocuSign`. In the "To User" field, choose the GitLab signatory for the contract. In the "CC" field, add the recruiter and the hiring manager. Then click "Preview on DocuSign".
1. You will be redirected to DocuSign.
1. On the top left of the screen, click where it says the candidate's name, then click "Edit Recipients". Change the `2` next to the GitLab signatory's name to a `1`, change the `1` next to the candidate's name to a `2` and change the `1` next to the hiring manager's name to a `2`. This ensures that the contract goes to the GitLab signatory to sign first, as well as the recruiter for a Cc and once signed by them it will go to the candidate and the hiring manager with a Cc. Then click "Done".
1. Scroll throughout the contract and double check that the candidate and GitLab signatory signature and date fields are accurately added. 
1. If there is an Exhibit A to the PIAA/List of Included Inventions section of the contract, be sure to add fields to be assigned to the candidate.
    - Navigate to where the PIAA/List of Included Inventions section is on the contract.
    - Make sure you've selected the candidate's name in the upper left hand corner dropdown.
    - On the left side under `Standard Fields`, drag a `Text` field over to underneath the Title, Date, and ID number area of the section. Resize to cover entire area for information.
    - Drag a `Checkbox` from the fields section on the right side to both areas needed (No invnetions, improvements area and additional sheets attached area)
    - On click on the Checkbox for `No Inventions` area and navigate to the right hand side of the page. Click `Conditional Logic` and `Create Rule`. Select `Unchecked` in the dropdown and click the Text box (it will grey out) and click `Done`. This will ensure that if the candidate does not click this box indicating they do have exceptions, they will need to fill in the text box before submitting their signature. 
        -  **You will need to create the conditional logic rule each time you send out contracts**, it does not save for future use. 
    - Add a `Signature` field, a `Name` field, and a `Date Signed` field to the correct areas.
1. There may also be other fields you'll need to add a textbox for, so double check if there are any other fields that need to be completed by either the candidate or GitLab signatory. Examples include adding a text box for "Place" on German contracts, or adding text boxes for PIAA at the bottom of most contracts. Once you've verified that all the information is correct and appropriately assigned, click "Send" at the top right corner.
1. You'll now be redirected back to Greenhouse, where you can monitor the progress of the contract and be able to see when each party signs it. Once it is signed by all parties, you and everyone cc'd on the original request will receive a confirmation email that it has been signed.
1. After sending the contract via DocuSign, ping the signatory in the #contracts-to-sign slack channel.
1. If you need to resend the contract, follow the same steps, but be sure to log into your DocuSign account and first delete the original one to avoid confusion.
1. Update the status of your open issue.

### How to add a contract into Greenhouse

1. In the GitLab Handbook, you'll navigate to [this link](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/) as a SSOT for all contract templates. Only the People Group, Finance, and Legal should have access to this folder.
1. Navigate to the correct entity of the contract you're attempting to update on the handbook page.
1. Click the link to the contract you're wanting to upload and it will open the Google Document.
1. Navigate to `File`, click `Download` and select `Microsoft Word`.
1. Log in to Greenhouse and go to "[Configure](https://app2.greenhouse.io/configure)" by clicking the gear at the top right corner, then choose "[Offer Templates](https://app2.greenhouse.io/account/offer_letter_templates)".
1. Navigate to and click the `Upload New` button (located underneath All Offer Sections).
1. Enter the template name (The convention is typically "GitLab `Entity` `employment-type`, `with/without bonus`", e.g. `GitLab Inc full-time, with variable bonus/commission`).
1. Click `Choose File` and choose the document you've downloaded and click `Save Template`. 
1. Greenhouse will upload the document and it will appear at the bottom of the page. There will be a `Test` button next to it; click this, and it will validate that all of the Greenhouse tokens are correctly inputted. If there are any errors, it will notify you. You will then need to go back to the template in Google Docs and correct the errors, redownload it, and reupload it to Greenhouse (after deleting the original one with mistakes). If all of the tokens are functioning properly, there will be green checkmarks, and you're ready to use this template for contracts!
    1. Check all of the token/fields to ensure they are formatted correctly (`{{ }}`). For each of the fields with curly brackets (`{ }`) in the template on Google Drive, find and replace that field (including the curly brackets) with the corresponding Greenhouse tokens (including the curly bracket). For example, `{Contributor Name}` in the Drive template will be replaced with `{{CANDIDATE_NAME}}`.
1. To delete a contract template from Greenhouse, click the three dots `...` to the right of the template name, then click delete and confirm.

The SSOT for the contract templates are on [this handbook page updated by Legal and People Connect](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/). Any updates to contracts will be done there first, and then the talent acquisition team needs to be pinged to be made aware of the changes so they can update the corresponding Greenhouse template.

These steps are executed by the **People Connect and Legal teams** when contracts are being updated, but for reference, if any changes need to be made to the templates, these tasks can be referenced below:
   1. Some fields that are not necessarily clear are the compensation fields as there are separate fields for the _vacancy_ and for the _candidate_; we want the candidate fields for the contract, so in Greenhouse, the appropriate token for salary is `{{CURRENCY}}`, bonus is `{{BONUS_AMOUNT}}`, and stock options is `{{STOCK_OPTIONS}}`. Another field that is easily confused is the title; the `{{JOB_NAME}}` is the name of the vacancy, which is not always necessarily the same as the title the candidate will have; to make sure it is always correct and includes the appropriate level and specialty for the candidate, use the token `{{FULL_TITLE__INCLUDING_LEVEL_AND_SPECIALTY_}}`.
   1. The one exception to the curly bracket find and replace process is the Belgian contract. The fields that need to be edited are highlighted.
   1. When removing optional clauses, take care that the paragraph / section numbering still makes sense.
   1. Double check that each field that needs to be filled out is replaced with a Greenhouse token. Sometimes it is not always obvious, as the curly bracket might be regular brackets by mistake.
   1. For each signature section, the following tokens **must** be on their own line in the document, with nothing else on the line: `{{CANDIDATE_SIGNATURE}}`, `{{CANDIDATE_SIGNATURE_DATE}}`, `{{COMPANY_SIGNATURE}}`, and `{{COMPANY_SIGNATURE_DATE}}`. Find each signature page, then hit enter to create the new line after the "Signature", "Name", "Title", and "Date" sections, then copy the corresponding Greenhouse tokens. These can be easy to miss, so double check each signature section has the appropriate Greenhouse tokens, each on their own line.
   1. Most contracts will have various versions that need to created, e.g. one that contains bonus language for variable bonus/commission, director/executive bonuses, or signing bonuses. Best practice is to create the contract containing all of the additional information and title it accordingly, then once you are done go to "File" in Google Docs and choose "Make a copy". Then remove the information as needed and rename the new document and continue the steps below. You can view other documents in the Greenhouse Templates folder for examples.
   1. For contract templates with variable bonus/commission plans, replace all paragraphs with the token `{{VARIABLE_BONUS_TYPE_OFFER_SECTION}}` which will tell Greenhouse to automatically choose the correct bonus type based on the offer package created in Greenhouse.
   1. To change or update a contract that has already been created and uploaded into Greenhouse, return to the corresponding Google Drive doc in the "Greenhouse Templates" folder, open the templates that need to be updated (there may be multiple that need to be changed, since there are different varieties of each contract to accommodate bonus structures, full-time/part-time, etc.), then update each accordingly. If you need to add new tokens to accommodate the change, be sure to follow step 5.3 in the above instructions. Once you have finished making any updates, click "File" in Google Docs, then "Download as" and "Microsoft Word (.docx)". Then go back to the "[Offer Templates](https://app2.greenhouse.io/account/offer_letter_templates)" section in Greenhouse. Find the contract that you are replacing, copy the name of it so you can maintain consistency, then click the three dots `...` to the right of the template name, then click delete and confirm. Then click "Upload New", paste the name of the template, and upload the new version. Click "Test" to validate that everything translated correctly (per step 9 above), and you are ready to use the new template.

### How to Send a Family Member Relationship Acknowledgment

Consistent with GitLab’s policy governing Hiring Significant Others or Family Members, GitLab is committed to a policy of employment and advancement based on **qualifications and merit** and does not discriminate in favor of or in opposition to the employment of significant others or family members. Any new hire that has a family member relationship that is currently employed at GitLab must sign [this acknowledgment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IseZy4zJZMgP0VCAsGqCP3I6sfnavGdD81THnqljaPI/edit?usp=sharing) along with the GitLab team member. This process is done in conjuction with sending out the contract.

1. If you have not been notified by the recruiter that there is a family relationship in play, there is now a field in the 'Offer Details' that will show whether a relationship exists. There should also be a *Family Member* tag on their profile. It, however, will not show who that family member is.
1. The Recruiter will post the name of the family member in the Private Notes within the Greenhouse profile. If not there, the CES will reach out to the recruiter to find out who the current GitLab team member is.
1. Once the family member is identified, you will send the [Family Member Relationship Acknowledgment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IseZy4zJZMgP0VCAsGqCP3I6sfnavGdD81THnqljaPI/edit?usp=sharing) via DocuSign to the new hire as well as the GitLab team member for signing.
1. Drag and drop the Family Member Relationship Acknowledgement form on DocuSign.
1. Add recipients using the following order:
- #1 GitLab Team Member (needs to sign)
- #2 New Hire (needs to sign)
- #3 CES (receives a copy)
1. After all parties have signed, upload a copy into both the new hire and the current GitLab team members Workday profile.
1. Upload Family Member Relationship Acknowledgement form into Workday.
   - Sign into Workday
   - Search the new hire's name
   - Click on the Personal Link on left side of screen
   - Select "Documents"
   - Select "Add"

### How to Void a Contract Before a Candidate Signs

In rare cases, we may rescind our offer before a candidate signs the contract. Work with the Recruiter, Hiring Manager, People Business Partner, VP of Talent Acquisition, and Contract Employment Counsel on ensuring uniform communication. Once the candidate has been informed verbally and via email by the talent acquisition team, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the email is exported into the Activity Feed in Greenhouse.
1. Void the contract in DocuSign utilizing the same communication that was emailed.
1. Reject the candidate in Greenhouse. Be sure to select 'Reject and Don't Send Email.'

### How to Void a Contract when the candidate declines the offer and not marked as hired in the system
 
In cases where the candidate has declined the offer verbally or via email to the talent acquisition team or CES, follow these steps once the recruiter confirms it is okay to void the contract:
1. Go to the docusign portal, under the “ waiting for others” tab, click on the candidate’s name whose contract needs to be voided. 
1. Under “More” tab, click “Void”. Enter the reason for voiding the contract e.g "Candidate declined offer" then click on Void.
1. Go to the candidate’s Greenhouse profile, make a note saying the contract is voided by copying the recruiter. This will prompt the recruiter to reject the candidate in GH if it hasn’t been done.

### How to Resend a Contract After Being Marked as Hired

There are certain times when a contract needs to get resent to the candidate after they have been hired into the system, should that happen. Follow the steps below:
1. If the req is already closed, tag the Enablement team in the greenhouse profile explaining the situation and that the req needs to be reopened to resend a contract.
1. Unhire the candidate in Greenhouse. (If the position is Closed, Enablement will need to assist with this step).
1. Resend the correct contract and follow standard steps for doing this.
1. Once you receive the contract back, **before** marking the candidate as hired in Greenhouse - ping the People Connect team in the `#peopleop-alerts-private` slack channel and explain exactly what the change was. The updated details will not update Workday (or BambooHR, if applicable) and will need to be manually corrected by the People Connect Team.
1. Upload the new contract to their Workday profile.
1. Ping the People Connect Team and let them know the contract has been updated and the details in Workday can be corrected.

For Talent Acquisition Enablement:
1. Once notified by the CES team, copy the Job Approval Chain and add it to the Approval Details Notes section. Include the names of the approvers, the dates approved, and the reason as to why the requisition is being re-opened. Tag the Finance Business Partner, CES, and Recruiter in this note.
1. From the Approvals page, select 'Edit Job & Openings'
1. Duplicate the Opening that needs to be re-opened.
1. Bypass approvals in the Job Approval section to change the Job Status from Draft to Open.
1. Inform CES once the req is open.
1. When the revised contract is uploaded by the CES, verify if the core fields on the offer remain the same. If it remains the same, bypass offer approvals and inform the CES once completed.
1. Once the CES team marks the candidate as hired in Greenhouse, close the duplicated opening and save changes.

### How to Keep Candidates Informed of Any Delays in the PEO Contract Process

Occasionally, there can be delays between the candidate receiving the PEO New Hire Document issued by the CES team and the official contract from a PEO. This delay can result in a nervous wait for the candidate. We must keep anyone who has not recieved their full contract from our PEO informed of any delays outside of the PEO SLAs.

The Candidate Experience Specialist who initiated the contract process is expected to follow up with the PEO every 24-48 hours until the contract is sent and will note of follow-up dates in the [PEO Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gSOVTJ1Yv-YsSaliJwKVf-1H0vBZXxb5NWFiqCwT-uo/edit#gid=0). This communciation should be sent in Greenhouse, so that the communication is captured in the activity feed. If there are any extreme circumstances that will result in a contract getting to the candidate outside of the PEO SLA's, the CES will also note those in the PEO Tracker. Recruiter is expected to keep the candidate updated on the progress of their contract every 24-48 hours until the candidate recieves their contract. A simple message that explains the delay is all that is neccessary. As a Candidate Experience Specialist or Recruiter, you're encouraged to utilize the Greenhouse reminder feature to manage these updates and log the email in Greenhouse.

## Amended Contracts

Contract amendments or modifications are processed by the Candidate Experience Specialist if the team member has not started or by the People Connect Team member if they have.

### Amendments prior to starting with GitLab:

If an amendment needs to be made and the previous contract was never active, the Candidate Experience Specialist should:

* Ask People Connect in the `people-exp_ces` Slack channel to delete the previous contract from Workday.
* Upload the updated contract in the Documents section of the team member Workday profile, using the 'Contracts and Changes' document category. 

_Note: It is essential that People Connect Team members are informed of all changes, as various fields must be updated in BambooHR._

### Amendments to contracts for new hires with planned relocations

1. Candidate Experience Specialist will ensure that there is verbiage clearly stating the terms of the compensation changes for relocation after the new hire’s start date and ensure that the Total Rewards team has approved both compensations.
1. If you are unsure about the Total Rewards approval, CES will ping the Total Rewards team in the Approval Notes.
    - Navigate to the bottom of the candidate’s GH profile
    - See “Approval Notes”
    - Click “Leave a Note”
    - Tag Brittany Rohde in a note to confirm that both compensation values have been approved
    - Tag the Recruiter as CC
1. Once Total Rewards has confirmed both have been reviewed and approved, generate the appropriate contract
1. Download the Word version of the contract and upload into Google Drive for editing
    - Navigate to Google Drive
    - Click “New” in the upper corner of the left toolbar
    - Select “File Upload”

    - Original
        - 10. Location. Your employment with GitLab is conditioned upon your permanent legal residence being near Boise, ID. If your permanent legal residence changes from that location you must notify the Company prior to any such changes. Changes to your permanent legal residence could result in a change to your compensation, benefits, and in some circumstances, termination of your employment.
    - Updated
        - 10. Location. Your employment with GitLab is conditioned upon your permanent legal residence being near Boise, ID and you've disclosed a planned move to San Francisco, CA on or around January 1st, 2021.

A contractor requests a modification to their contract due to a name change/company incorporation (Example: The individual recently incorporated a company, and would like to invoice GitLab through their company versus individually)

* The People Connect Team member should log the requested change in the Documents section of the team member Workday profile, using the 'Contracts and Changes' document category.
* The People Connect Team member should draft the new contract using the appropriate template in the [Employment and Contractor Agreements](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#employment-agreements) section. ***Please remember to always make a copy of the template before editing.***

_Important: Employment contracts cannot be backdated. If a team member requests to backdate a contract for invoicing purposes, an addendum should be added to the contract stating: "As the Contractor has not invoiced GitLab for payment since their start date on `contractor start date`, GitLab will pay the Contractor for this period of time in accordance with the Contractor’s base compensation". The start date on the new contract should always reflect the date the contract is staged for signatures._

* The People Connect Team member should stage the contract in DocuSign to be signed by both the team member and the Director of People Operations.
* Once siged by both parties, the contract should be uploaded to the Documents section of the team member Workday profile, using the 'Contracts and Changes' document category.

### How to Unhire a Candidate After Contract is Signed
If for some reason a candidate declines an offer after they have been hired into the system, whoever receives that information needs to make sure `@ces` is tagged in the Greenhouse profile and is made aware that the candidate will no longer be starting at GitLab. Please note that the steps below are assuming that the person will not be working for GitLab; if you are hoping to just amend their offer after they've been marked as hried, please view the Resend process above. 

If they have been hired in Greenhouse and exported to BambooHR, Enablement will need to follow these steps:
1. Unhire the candidate in Greenhouse if the req is still open. If the req is closed, Enablement will need to be brought in to unhire.
1. Ask the Recruiter to reject them in Greenhouse; add reasons in notes, you may add the email that was sent by the candidate. Click ‘reject and don’t send email’.  
1. Cancel any scheduled emails in Greenhouse.
1. Tag the VP, People Operations in the `#people-group-confidential` Slack channel and ask to remove the profile from BambooHR and @ mention the @people-exp team for visibility. Only a BambooHR owner (at GitLab this is the VP, People Operations) can remove the profile, this is why this step is so important. 
1. If they were hired via a PEO, inform the contact person at the PEO of this change immediately, ideally before onboarding starts. If they are in a country that uses outside payroll, we will need to inform the payroll company as well. 
1. Message IT, People Connect, and the Sr. Background Check Specialist in the #peopleops-alerts-private channel to let them know to cancel any laptop orders, onboarding issues, background checks, and remove from Workday.
1. If the Recruiter has not already tagged the FP&A approver in the Greenhouse notes, please tag them to let them know that the candidate has withdrawn.

## Letter of Adjustment

When a team member applies for and receives a new position through Greenhouse, a Letter of Adjustment is prepared in lieu of a new contract using DocuSign. The Candidate Experience Specialist will prepare the letter. This document is signed by the Director, Total Rewards or the Sr. Director, Global People Operations or the Chief People Officer and the team member through DocuSign. Using the Offer through DocuSign - Letter of Adjustment template in Greenhouse the letter is cc'd to peopleops@gitlab.com team for processing.

Effective dates for a letter of adjustment should be the first (1st) of the month or the sixteenth (16th). For Sales or Sales Development team members, they can only be the first of the month. These effective dates do not need to be on a business day and should be adhered to payroll purposes. 
Please note that LOAs cannot be used if a team member is moving from the Federal, LLC. entity into any other entity **or** any entity that is not Federal, LLC into the Federal, LLC. entity. In those cases, a new contract **must** be issued as there are tax implications to this entity.

When generating a letter of adjustment for a PEO, the steps remains the same as outlined below. However, select the LOA template that does not include RSUs, and send the RSU details via DocuSign email.

The Candidate Experience Specialist needs to merge any additional candidate profiles before marking as hired. If the profiles are not merged, it will create a duplicate and mess with the employment bot sync to Workday & BambooHR. The signed letter is uploaded into Workday under the Contracts and Changes folder on the Documents Tab by the Total Rewards Analyst. 

When an internal transition is taking place and the start date for that LOA is amended, please ensure to update the People Connect team via Slack in the `#people-exp_ces` channel of the new start date.

If a team member goes through a promotion through WorkDay versus Greenhouse, a [Letter of Adjustment](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#letter-of-adjustment) is prepared by the Total Rewards team as listed on their handbook page.

CES: Follow the instructions below on how to create and send a letter of adjustment. 

1. Confirm that the start date is either on the 1st or 16th of the month. For Sales or Sales Development, the start date should be the 1st. This is for payroll purposes and does not need to be on a business day. 
1. The signatory matches the appropriate entity. If the candidate is located in the US (including Federal), Morgan Wilkins can be a signatory. If the candidate is employed through a PEO, Morgan Wilkins and Marissa Ferber can be signatories (this process is subject to change)
1. Next, Click Generate 
1. Select Letter of adjustment template in Greenhouse:
- Letter of Adjustment w/ OTE
- Letter of Adjustment w/ no OTE 
1. Click on Send through Docusign 
1. You will be redirected to DocuSign.
1. On the top left of the screen, click where it says the candidate's name, then click "Edit Recipients". Change the order of recipients to reflect the following order:
- #1 is Director, Total Rewards (needs to sign)
- #1 Hiring Manager (receives a copy)
- #2 Candidate (needs to sign)
- #3 People Ops (receives a copy)
- #3 Nitin Upadhyay (receives a copy)
- This ensures that the contract goes to the GitLab signatory to sign first, as well as the recruiter for a Cc and once signed by them it will go to the People Experience for an update of records. 
1. Then click "Done".
1. When LOA is signed, ensure that you merge profiles before Hiring to avoid creating duplicate profile

## Rehires

In the event that a former team member is rehired with the company, they will still go through the normal interviewing process and standard onboarding. Once the contract is signed, CES should ensure that there are no profiles left to merge and that `Former Team Member` is selected as the Source. These two things ensure no duplicate profiles are created and no manual hiring has to be done into the Workday system. They should have their old hire record on their Greenhouse account.

Should the candidate be marked as hired and the source was not updated beforehand, please let People Connect know as soon as possible in #peopleops-alerts-private to let them know that a manual fix will need to be done.

## Process for GitLab team-members in the Netherlands
In this location, a temporary contract (tijdelijk contract) is for 12 months, with a pre-determined end date. A dismissal procedure is not required to terminate a temporary contract at the end of its duration. However communication about the extension of the contract must happen at the latest 1 month before the actual contract end date (aanzegtermijn).

It is common for Dutch employers to offer a second temporary contract when the first expires, but it's not guaranteed. As a Dutch employer, this is standard procedure for GitLab. As of 2015-07-01, employees who have worked with an employer on temporary contracts for at least two years are entitled to an indefinite contract if the work agreement continues, and this is known as the chain rule (ketenregeling).

The process for New Hires is as follows:

1. The offer is made by the recruiter per the [hiring process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).
1. If the BSN and date of birth are not filled out and cannot be found in a reference check form, the Candidate Experience Specialist can use the emails the email template Contract Info Request - the Netherlands from GreenHouse and send to the candidate.
1. Ensure the start date is on a Monday, unless Monday is a holiday or the non-Monday date is legally required.
1. The Candidate Experience Specialist will update the GreenHouse Offer Details with BSN and Date of Birth when the new team member provides the necessary details and then generates the "IT BV Employee Temporary - the Netherlands" contract out of GreenHouse.
1. The Candidate Experience Specialist will stage the contract for signature via DocuSign, CC the hiring manager, and CC the HRSavvy group email. This will ensure our payroll provider in this location can start their onboarding, well ahead of ours.
1. Please note that you should _not_ be running a criminal background check for the Netherlands, because they'll be doing a different process (Certificate of Good Conduct/VoGS) instead. Please only run an employment verification. 

The People Operation Specialist are in charge of [contract renewals](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#contract-renewals). The process the **end of the first 12-month GitLab BV Netherlands temporary contract** is listed in their [Netherlands Renewal Process](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#netherlands-renewal-process) section of the [Contracts, Probation Periods & PIAA](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/) handbook page.

_GitLab IT BV contracts should only be used for contractors. All Netherlands **employees** should be issued the GitLab BV contract._

## Employment Agreements for GitLab team members in China

GitLab is working in partnership with [CIIC](http://www.ciicsh.com/ciicsh/ywsy/index.html) to employ GitLab team-members located in China. Signed agreements between GitLab and CIIC are required to employ any new hire. Therefore, there will be a lead time of approximately three weeks prior to starting. As soon as it becomes clear that an offer to a candidate is going to be made, People Ops will reach out to CIIC to begin the process. The process for preparing the agreements between all parties is as follows:

**GitLab and New Hire:**

1. Once the verbal offer has been made by the recruiter [hiring process](/handbook/hiring/) complete the [Template-GitLab China Employee Offer letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c69dG9TuAB0MgiKj_gLDuHTHpzjocvEAm2okUOKqRIs/edit#) as per [How to use this page to prepare a contract](#how-to-use).

1. Once this has been done send the GitLab (Chinese & English) versions of the Letter of Employment Intent to the new hire for their review, completion and signature using DocuSign. Ensure that Peopleops and CIIC are copied.
1. Once everything has been signed, print and FedEx the Chinese and English Letter of Intents to CIIC. The address can be found in the PEO China folder > China Employment Options > CIIC in the Google Drive.
1. The Candidate Experience Specialist should add the candidate to the [PEO Tracking Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gSOVTJ1Yv-YsSaliJwKVf-1H0vBZXxb5NWFiqCwT-uo/edit#gid=0) and keep track of communication between GitLab.

1. The Candidate Experience Specialist will now [mark the candidate as hired](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/coordinator/#send-contract). See steps 10-12.

**GitLab & CIIC:**

1. GitLab has a Secondment Agreement in place with CIIC, this may need to be updated but CIIC will confirm.
1. Once CIIC have received the documents they will prepare a payment notice and send this to GitLab (peopleops) for payment. This must be paid upfront and may need CFO approval.

## Employment Agreements for GitLab team members in Germany

Please note, due to German labor law, the stock options are not included in the contract template and are not to be listed on the contract. If the candidate asks specifically for this information to be listed on the contract, please seek guidance from the CES Team Lead and/or Legal. 

German contracts require wet signature, which is a physical copy of the contract signed by both parties. To initiate this process:
1. CES will ensure that the start date is either a Monday, or the 1st or 16th of the month
1. CES will send German Contract Step 1 template email via Greenhouse
1. Offer can be sent through Greenhouse and DocuSign. Please use Rob Allen as the signatory unless requested otherwise due to his OOO. 
1. Initiate the background check. The Germany package can be utilized, but if required to use a la carte instead, please choose Extended Global Sanctions as the criminal check due to local laws. 
1. Once the digital contract has been signed through DocuSign, send an unsigned copy of the contract to the signatory via the "Email to team" function in Greenhouse. The template is called "German contract to mail".
1. CES adds the candidate to the German contract tracker. A link to this is in the contract templates received in the Service Desk.
1. A non-US welcome email should be sent to the candidate, and they should be marked as hired. 
1. CES will regularly check in with the candidate to ensure they have received their contract in the mail. When that happens, they will send the email template "German Contract step 2" to the candidate and close out the issue. 

Former QES instructions: As of August 1, 2022, we are no longer able to send contracts through Qualified Electronic Signature. We are keeping the instructions here for 6 months while we await any changes to the law, and will remove them if the laws do not change again. To send a contract with QES, select "edit recipients" in DocuSign when editing your contract, select "customize", and choose "select signature type". Select IDNow - EU Qualified. You should select this for **both** signatories. Do not select this for anyone who is CC'ed.

This additional step will require signatories to present government issued identification to the IDNow team when signing their contract. 

If you cannot find the QES option on your DocuSign, you may need to switch your open account. Select your name in the upper right corner of DocuSign. If it says the account is "GitLab Main", switch your access to your PeopleOps account. If you do not see another account, please check with Enablement.
