      * Team members who are assessed at a Performing or Exceeding Performance level during Talent Assessment are eligible to be considered for another role
      * Team members whose Performance is assessed as Developing or are actively undergoing written performance management, may not be eligible. These situations require manager and/or PBP approval to proceed.

   * Create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/internal-hiring/-/issues?sort=created_date&state=opened) in the [hiring process repo](/gitlab-com/people-group/internal-hiring).
   * If a Recruiter has reached out to you, please feel free to reach out directly to them on status updates of your specific process.

   * Reach out to People Connect by emailing people-connect@gitlab.com with the following subject line “Eligibility Check for internal team member”. In the body of the email please include the team member name and the link to their Greenhouse application.
   * Once the Recruiter is notified that the eligibility check is completed via the private notes in Greenhouse, and if eligible, Recruiter will reach out to the team member to introduce themselves and set expectations around the process. If a team member is not eligible, Recruiter will send the appropriate decline email template. 
* Recruiter will then continue the process as described in the [Talent Acquisition Process Framework](/handbook/hiring/talent-acquisition-framework/) for all candidates. Recruiter will use identified templates in Greenhouse to communicate with candidates, current managers and hiring managers throughout the internal hiring process. 
* If an internal candidate is moved to offer, the Recruiter will ask the internal candidate what their compensation expectations are. Recruiter will input that information in the private notes section of Greenhouse and share it with the hiring manager. 
* Once an internal candidate verbally accepts an offer, the Recruiter will notify CES to get the Letter of Adjustment (LOA) to the team member.

## CES Responsibilities
