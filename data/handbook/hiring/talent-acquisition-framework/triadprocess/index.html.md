### The Triad Process

The Triad process exists to connect the various functional representatives from the PBP group, Finance and Talent Acquisition together to ensure seamless collaboration, reporting and metrics tracking. 

This group meets once a week and cross checks the centralized recruiting report for their area against reports owned by Finance so that we can ensure transparency and correct budget tracking.

The relevant TA leader is the DRI in the meeting based on the fact that they are ultimately responsible for TA metrics and reporting for their group.

In the meeting, the TA leader is responsible for showing their current reporting and requisition status and partner with their FBP to ensure alignment on approved headcount reporting.

In this meeting, Finance will also be responsible for keeping the PBP and TA leader informed of any upcoming investments or information that may materially affect TA capacity or direction in any way. 

The successful output of the Triad meeting is aligned reporting between all parties and one source of truth for requisition status and hire data.
