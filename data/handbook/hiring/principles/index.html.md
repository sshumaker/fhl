## Principles of Hiring

We've intentionally crafted our hiring and talent acquisition practices to align with the GitLab culture, and we've outlined the foundational ethos that drives our talent ethos. These principles will guide our talent strategies and tactical employment and hiring decisions. We want to state up front that one of the advantages of being a remote company is that we can hire talent from anywhere, not just the San Francisco Bay Area. We want to ensure we are finding the best talent the world has to offer. It may take more effort to find talent in more diverse places, but that is an effort we are willing to make.

## Collaboration

* Lean on our community and users for their global talent and networks
* Develop a rich and robust referral program
* Foster cross-company understanding of roles and open positions
* Distribute ownership of team building and hiring across full company
* Encourage internal applications, support career transitioning

## Results

* Identify and source high potential candidates from varied industries
* Build long-term hiring forecasts and talent maps
* Make talent a long term priority with a deep true vision and strategy
* Hire the right person for the right role at the right time
* Transform talent from a cost center to an organizational value add
* Measure employee engagement and candidate experience

## Efficiency
* Respect candidate and employee time in hiring
* Adopt and optimize tools to ease candidate and employee communication
* Create a repeatable, standard process that is well documented
* Support training and knowledge transfer
* Source for candidates in Low Cost areas

## Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

* Source from talent from various regions around the world, not just the major technology hubs
* Improve company inclusion and buy-in at every level
* Commit to removing bias from the hiring process at every Opportunity
* Hire and evaluate for potential over privilege
* Tell employee stories that reflect our workforce

Equal Employment Opportunity

 Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  is one of GitLab's core [values](/handbook/values/) and
 GitLab is dedicated to providing equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all team members
 and candidates for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender,
 national origin, age, disability, caste, class, or genetics. One example of how we put this into practice
 is through sponsorship of [diversity events](/blog/2016/03/24/sponsorship-update/)

 GitLab complies with all applicable laws governing nondiscrimination in employment. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including talent acquisition, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer,
 leaves of absence, compensation, and training. GitLab expressly prohibits any form of workplace harassment.
 Improper interference with the ability of GitLabâ€™s team members to perform their role duties
 may result in discipline up to and including discharge. If you have any complaints, concerns,
 or suggestions to do better please [contact People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#reach-peopleops).

## Iteration

* Hiring process is always in draft and can always be improved
* Streamline and simplify hiring and employment processes without sacrificing quality

## Transparency

* Give every candidate a response
* Document the hiring process and keep it updated
* Share insights and hiring achievements often and with everyone
* Provide honest and kind feedback when asked (try to separate the interview from the decision, and from the feedback)
* Share hiring plans internally and announce opening positions before publishing
* We avoid outbound outreach to people working for GitLab customers who are making frequent & impactful contributions to the GitLab product or community
