### I applied for a job on your careers page. What's next?

Thanks for your interest in GitLab! Our team will reach out if they need more information from you. In the meantime, read about what you can expect during the interview process below. 

If your experience is a good fit for the role, we will be in touch soon. Please note that it's not possible for us to respond to every candidate, but we aim to review every application.

## Screening Call

### Screening Call expectations

If it is determined that you qualify for continued consideration, the assigned Recruiter will conduct a screening call with you. Calls can last anywhere between 30 and 40 minutes (some specialist roles require more time), depending on the conversation. The Recruiter will wait 5 minutes for you to show up to the appointed video call, which is always shared via email. If you do not show up to the interview, or do not reach out in advance to reschedule, you will be classified as a no show and be disqualified. We will unreject when circumstances beyond your control cause you to miss a scheduled call.

You, the recruiter or the hiring manager can terminate the discussion at any point during the interview if either party determines that it isn’t a fit. Be as transparent and honest as possible and provide feedback.

Depending on the outcome of the call, the talent acquisition team or manager may either reject or move you to the Team Interview stage.

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Example Screening Call questions</summary>

1. Why are you interested in GitLab?
1. What are you looking for in your next position?
1. Why did you join and leave your last three positions?
1. What is your experience with X? (for each of the skills listed in the position description)
1. [STAR Method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) questions and simple technical or skills-related questions
1. What is your current location and do you have any plans to relocate? (relevant in context of compensation, country-hiring guidelines, and in case an offer would be made)
1. Do you require visa sponsorship or a work/study permit to work for GitLab? Or do you require the work permit to be transferred to GitLab? If the answer is yes, we will not be able to proceed, [unless you currently hold a work permit in the Netherlands](/handbook/people-group/visas/#dutch-work-permits). You can refer to the [Visa and Sponsorship](/handbook/people-group/visas/#visas-and-sponsorhip) handbook section for further clarity.
1. What is the notice period you would need if you were hired?
1. Is this salary range in line with your expectations? At GitLab, we are committed to paying competitively and equitably. Therefore, we set our offers based on market pay rather than a candidate's pay history. We walk through the [Compensation Calculator](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/) with each candidate so that we can address any gaps in expectations early on. Only candidates who are in the team interview stage or later can access our [compensation calculator](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/) by following `applicants sign up`.

At the end of the screening call, the Recruiter will tell you what the next steps will be, if any. There should be time for you to ask any questions you may have.

</details>


## Team Interviews

### Team Interviews expectations

After the Screening Call, a candidate will move into the Team Interviews stage if the Recruiter decides that the candidate is fit for the role. Team Interviews may consist of behavioral, panel and/or [technical interviews](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/technical/) (certain positions).

Feel free to ask your Recruiter which type of interview you can expect.


### Interview Process FAQs

<details markdown="1">

<summary>How to request for a reasonable accommodation</summary>

We want our interview process to be accessible to everyone. You can inform us of any reasonable adjustments we can make to better accommodate your needs by emailing `ces@gitlab.com` at any point in the interview process. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment. As part of our [interviewing process](/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#adjustments-to-our-interview-process), we ask all applicants if they require any type of adjustment or accommodation.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>I've started the interview process at GitLab, but haven't heard back from anyone recently. What do I do?</summary>

Feel free to send an email to your Recruiter to get a status update on where you are in the interview process.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Can I have the hiring team’s email addresses so I can send them a note?
</summary>

Yes. You can email your Recruiter or ces@gitlab.com to request your interviewer's email address.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Can I interview for multiple roles at the same time?
</summary>

You can apply to multiple roles and during the screening call you and the recruiter (when possible) will determine what role would be best for you. This means that it can happen that you'll be introduced to another recruiter after the screening call, depending on the outcome. When you already have interviewed with us, you can apply for a different role again, but please take note that there can be a cooldown period of 6 months or more if it's a similar role, depending on the reason for not moving forward which is communicated by the recruiter.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Do you offer interview reimbursements?</summary>

If you are invited for an interview with GitLab and you need financial support for your interview, you may be reimbursed for the following:

- Childcare or adult care for dependents
- Rental costs associated with laptop or computer if you don't own or have access to one
- Transportation to a facility with internet access if your home does not have reliable internet service
- Meeting room costs in a co-working space if your environment is not conducive to an interview
- Translation services if you are d/Deaf or hard of hearing

To initiate the reimbursement process, please email `ces@gitlab.com`. 

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>I've been rejected, when can I reapply?</summary>

If your application is rejected because you are insufficiently qualified for the role, you are welcome to reapply to the same position once 6 months have passed. If you gain the skills, experience, or knowledge we outlined in our [feedback to you](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/#rejecting-candidates), you are welcome to reapply at any time. 

</details>

### Inclusive interviewing

The GitLab team understands the importance of inclusive interviewing, and we strive to ensure our hiring team is well versed in every aspect of diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence. A positive and comfortable candidate experience is our priority.

### How we conduct remote interviews on a global scale

<details markdown="1">

<summary>How we work during holidays</summary>

As an all-remote, global company, GitLab gives all team members the flexibility to determine their [time away from work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/), including the holidays they observe.
There will likely be holidays that our candidates observe that a Recruiter, Hiring Manager, or CES may not.
If there's a time during the year when a significant portion of the company will be taking time off, we'll be sure to send a communication to all active candidates to let them know of a possible delay in communication.
Please note that not every member of the team will be observing that holiday, so you may still receive emails from them.

</details>

<details markdown="1">

<summary>How we schedule interviews on a global scale</summary>

1. Once you have completed a screening call with the recruiter and are ready to be scheduled for the Team Interview stage, you'll receive an email requesting availability. To move through this process as quickly as possible, please give us many different days and times spread across at least 2 weeks. This will prevent us from having to reach out again asking for more availability, as some interviewers could be across many different time zones. Sometimes if the interviewer has a schedule that is difficult to fit interviews into, we'll suggest specific times and dates via your availability link.
1. After receiving your availability, we will compare it to the interviewers' working hours. If we find a match, we will schedule an interview and send you a link to a Guide and invite in your time zone to download to your computer. If we do not, we will reach back out and work with you to find an alternative. Sometimes there is a very small overlap between time zones, so we appreciate your patience as we identify alternatives!
1. If you need to reschedule, follow the special instructions in your confirmation email if the interview is within 24 hours. You can also email ces@gitlab.com anytime. 

</details>

## References

### How references are conducted

References will be collected towards the end of the interview stage and they must be checked before an offer is made. The Hiring Manager or hiring team will contact your references. 

Three references will be requested and at least one needs to be a past manager. If you have only had 1 manager, and it is at your current company, it is okay to skip the manager reference (though at least two total references will still be required).

## Offer & Background Check

Depending on your location, a [background check](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-policies/#background-screenings) will be initiated at the same time as references or once an offer has been extended. 

## Where does GitLab hire people? 

At GitLab, we hire people from all over the world and all walks of life. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging  is one of our [core values](/handbook/values/). As an [all-remote company](/company/culture/all-remote/) we do face challenges with hiring in certain countries. Each country has unique and complex rules, laws, and regulations, that can affect our ability to conduct business, as well as the employability of the citizens and residents of those countries. It unfortunately affects the employability of the citizens and residents of those countries. We are growing and continuously exploring our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies. At present we are focusing our hiring in countries where we have entities & PEO's (Professional Employer Organization).
