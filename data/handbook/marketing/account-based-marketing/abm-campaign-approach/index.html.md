## Account Based Marketing Overview
{: #integrated-campaigns .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
The goal of ABM is to strategically engage and convert our [First Order Key Accounts](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/key-account-lists) to Sales Accepted Opportunities leveraging a variety of marketing channels and offers. 

**[ABM Managers](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/)** are responsible for the strategizing of ABM campaigns and organizing timelines and DRIs for deliverables to execute on the campaigns.

**Questions? Please feel free to ask in the [#abmteam slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CFBT2HSEB) or ask in the [#marketing slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C0AKZRSQ5) and tag @abm-team.**

## Tier 1

### Tier 1 Planning
{: #tier1-planning .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In FY23 Q2, the ABM Team has kicked off a single Tier 1 pilot in each region to establish process and gain an understanding of what steps in the approach are productive, and which we can remove for efficiency.

The accounts selected for the Tier 1 pilots were defined by the Regional VPs. These accounts are **First Order** (no customers in the hierarchy) as this is currently the focus for Marketing, determined by sales and marketing leadership and aligned to the overarching business model.

**There will be an epic for every Tier 1 Account - created by the ABM Manager for the region.**  [See Tier 1 Campaign Steps](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/abm-campaign-approach/#tier1-campaign-steps)
