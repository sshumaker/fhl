Are you interested in contributing to GitLab? Check out the available [contribution opportunities here](/community/contribute/).

# Overview

From the beginning, GitLab has been an open source project and we want to continue growing community code contribution. This will be accomplished by lowering the barrier to entry for new contributors and also by helping casual contributors become regular contributors. We want GitLab to be the open source project of choice for open source developers.

## Contact

You can reach out to us at `contributors AT gitlab DOT com` via e-mail.

### Community code of conduct

Like most open source projects, the GitLab Community also has a [code of conduct](/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) to foster an open and welcoming environment. Instances of abusive, harassive, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to `conduct@gitlab.com`.

In case of a code of conduct violation, the following steps will be taken:

1. The offending community member will be reminded of the [code of conduct](/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) and asked to be constructive and respectful. This will typically be a public communication, for example in an issue or a merge request.
2. If there is a repeated offense, the community member will be contacted privately (e.g. via email) and warned that any subsequent offenses will not be tolerated and will lead to the community member being blocked from GitLab.com.
3. After the third incident, ask the `@abuse-team` in the `#abuse` Slack channel to block the individual from GitLab.com.

In general, it is best not to argue with someone who is not being constructive/respectful, and one should just focus on facts if you need to respond. If you need help with your response (including reviewing a draft of your response), you can ask in the `#community-relations` channel in Slack or email `conduct@gitlab.com`.

### Getting Help

If you are looking to get help for any topics in regards to your Contribution Journey please refer to the get-help section at the [contributing guide](/community/contribute/development/#need-help). For example:
- Run out of CI/CD minutes
- Need a GitLab license to contribute
- I have a technical question
- My merge request has not been triaged or reviewed
- I am contributing to GitLab but can't be verified because I don't own a credit card 

### Connect 

A GitLab contributor room is available on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/contributors) for people interested in contributing to GitLab. This is open to everyone to join and is a good place for community members to network and help each other.

### Community Related events

Community events are taking place regularly to support our thriving community of contributors and drive contributions.
All of the events are posted on our [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/gitlab-virtual-meetups/).

Events
- [GitLab quarterly Hackathon](https://about.gitlab.com/community/hackathon/).
- [Community office hour calls](https://www.meetup.com/gitlab-virtual-meetups/).

### Swag

We want to recognize amazing contributions from the wider community with GitLab swags.
All GitLab team members and members of the wider community are encouraged to nominate others or themselves (for campaigns such as #myfirstMRmerge - having their first MR merged).
Please refer to the [nomination criteria and form for more details](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/community-appreciation/).
