## Let's Award Contributors Together

We want to recognize amazing contributions from the wider community with GitLab swags.
All GitLab team members and members of the wider community are encouraged to nominate others or themselves (for campaigns such as #myfirstMRmerge).

We'll be using Printfection's giveaway links to make this happen.

## Include Everyone

If you think that someone deserves a swag prize, nominate them!
If you reached an important campaign milestone (e.g. #myfirstMRmerged) with your contribution, you can also nominate yourself!

## Eligibility
 
Anyone who you feel deserves an extra special something for their contribution, comment, or community involvement is eligible for swag.

This can include, (but is not limited to): 
* Great contributions to the GitLab product via issues or merge requests
* Representing the voice of GitLab at a speaking event, with a blog post, at a Meetup, or with a presentation
* Achieving the `#myfirstMRmerged` milestone
* Leaving a great answer on our [community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/)
* Posting a great answer to on a [GitLab StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gitlab) or [GitLab subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/) question
* Bug Bounty reporters who submitted a quality report that did not qualify for monetary reward in our [Bug Bounty program](https://hackerone.com/gitlab?type=team). 

For cases not listed above, use your best judgement, and create a merge request to add new cases to the list.

### Eligibility for Self Nomination

If you've contributed to our community or reached an important campaign milestone, you're eligible to self nominate for GitLab swag. Note that to self nominate, you must provide relevant links and evidence of your contributions to be evaluated by the GitLab team.

| Contribution | Notes for Self Nomination|
| ------ | ------ |
| #myfirstMRmerged | Must include link the merged MR |
| Community Blog Post | Must include link to published blog post |
| GitLab Forum Answer | Must include link to high quality answer provided on the GitLab Forum |
| Meetup/Presentation | Must include link to the meetup/event page |

*  To nominate a wider community member for swag, or nominate yourself for swag, please fill the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGo-3kEimVPpC5zKKxXHkFjgYx8-vQAanzAX2LxGgXQqXikQ/viewform).
