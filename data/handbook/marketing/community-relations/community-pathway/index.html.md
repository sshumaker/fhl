### Join us

The community team has always partenered with internal and external teams to empower the community and we are always seeking collaboration to do more. Every community program has an Issue board where you can create an issue to kickstart a collaboration of if you are a GitLab team member and unsure of where to start, you can always drop by the `#community-relations` channel on slack.
