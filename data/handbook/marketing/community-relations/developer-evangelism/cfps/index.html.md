## How we manage CFPs (Call for Proposals)

### Our events list

Every year, developer evangelism prioritizes some key events in our ecosystem for which we run the conference proposal (CFP) process. 

- [FY24 - Developer Evangelism Event Strategy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/3538)

The event engagement with lightning talks, CFP submissions, etc. is organized in issues which are linked and summarized in the strategy epic. You can also find a calendar view of our events below:

### CFP Library 

Past submissions for CFPs are stored in the [CFP Library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KX8uf-4Ov8ybztJibQlGr9HvgH9VobpA8Nv5ecny1N4/edit#gid=0).

## Requesting a Developer Evangelist to submit a CFP

To request that a Developer Evangelist submits a CFP to your event, please:

1. [Open a new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/dev-evangelism/meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=developer-evangelist-request) 
1. Ensure you use the `developer-evangelist-request` template, and fill out the `External Request` section.
1. Label the issue with the `CFP` label.

### CFP Management

For every CFP process we are participating in, a [CFP issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=CFP-Meta) is created with details about the event, requirements for CFP submissions and any other relevant information that might be useful to potential speakers. The issue template contains guide on the necessary steps needed to ensure we keep track of all the submissions for each CFP.

Once a submission has been submitted, the author should add it to the [CFP Library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KX8uf-4Ov8ybztJibQlGr9HvgH9VobpA8Nv5ecny1N4/edit#gid=0). This will allow us to repurpose CFPs efficiently.

#### Issue Workflow

All submissions, accepted talks, feedback and other result tracking happens in the CFP issue. The CFP workflow uses [scoped labels](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/workflow/#cfp-labels) to transition the issues through different stages. Please follow the [CFP workflow handbook](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/workflow/#cfp-workflow) to apply required labels accordingly. 

All issues wuth the `CFP` label appear on the dedicated [CFP Issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/boards/2415569?&label_name[]=CFP).
