[The Lab](
https://techstrong.tv/videos/the-lab) is a recurring video podcast series (previously hosted by Brendan O’Leary) on [Techstrong TV](
https://techstrong.tv/). The show format consists of the host covering the top updates from the latest GitLab release, then optionally brining in a guest to discuss more details on a particular topic—either a GitLab team member or technology partner.

The general outline of a typical production consists of:

- Pre-show preparation from Highwire team
- Recording time with host controlling recording
- Running the show as “one take” for 10-20 minutes of recording time
- Post-show production with Highwire and Techstrong TV

Below, you can find more details on each of these steps.

## Pre-show Prep
Leading up to the recording of the show, Highwire PR will prepare a [media request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/media-request.md) template issue in the [Corporate Marketing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing) project. This issue will include at least:

- The host for the show
- A briefing document (prepared by Highwire)
- Any notes about guests
- Any special notes for this recording

An [example issue can be found here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/7214).

The briefing document is what is used during the run of the show to control the show flow, topics, and other details about the show. The document will include:

- Title for this episode, including GitLab version number to be discussed
- Recording date and time
- Zoom link
- Host & any guests
- Background and recording notes for the guests to review before the recording
- Episode flow, to include: intro and outro script, talking points that will be used by the host to focus on key items from the release, any questions and prep done for the guest ahead of time.
- “Stage directions” for host and guest to know when to come off mute / bring in the guest / etc.

In this way, the Episode Flow section serves almost as a pseudo-script for the episode, and should make it very efficient for the host to prep and run the recording of the show.

## Recording settings
To record the session, use Zoom “Record to Cloud” on the highest available settings. This will automatically record the combined video, each individual's camera, any screen sharing, etc. as both separate and combined files. This allows the editing team ultimate flexibility in putting together the episode. It also provides a simple sharing method through Zoom's website once the recording is processed.

## Run of show
The run of the show and agenda for the Zoom call where the recording takes places typically looks something like:

- Introductions with Highwire team member assigned to the call, guest, host, etc.
- Mic and camera check
- Review from Highwire team of briefing document and flow for the episode
- Highwire, guest, etc. mute their mics and cameras for the host to open the show
- Host selects “Record to Cloud" to record the episode
- Host counts down from 5 to indicate start to the editing team
- Host uses episode flow section of briefing document to run the show, bring in guest, etc.
- Highwire team member is present and timing to note any needed edits (for instance if the host or guest needs to take a drink of water or start over a statement)
- Host gives a "beat" after the outro and then ends the recording
- Thank the guest for joining and Highwire for their help and end the call

## Post-show production 
After the recording is complete, it will take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour for Zoom to process the recording. Once the processing is done, you should get a notification in your Zoom app. If not, you can also go check [gitlab.zoom.us](https://gitlab.zoom.us) under “Recordings”.

That Recording section will have a “Share” button that allows you to copy the Zoom sharing information. Share that information in a DM with the Highwire team member assigned to this episode, and note that you shared the recording in the issue.

From there, Highwire will work with Techstrong TV to get them the recording, any notes from the session, and any other materials mentioned in the show. Techstrong will edit the final show and post it to [The Lab website](https://techstrong.tv/videos/the-lab). Highwire should then update the issue with the link to the live show.
