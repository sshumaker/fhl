#### Adding a new tool to the Community Relations tool stack

1. Please follow the procurement process as you would for [adding any new tool to GitLab's tech stack](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack-applications/#add-new-system-to-the-tech-stack).
1. Ensure that the `group_owner` field on the tech stack file entry is set to `Community Relations`. This will make the tool to be automatically listed on the [Community Relations toolstack](#tool-stack-overview).
