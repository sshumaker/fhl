## <i class="far fa-newspaper" id="biz-tech-icons"></i>  Our mission

At GitLab, our mission is to make it so that [everyone can contribute](/company/mission/#mission).

The Community Relations team supports this mission by working with our community to ensure they receive support and recognition for contributing to GitLab. Contributing to GitLab can include blog posts, code, documentation, discussions on forums/social media, meetups, presentations, translations, UX design, and more. We also support educational institutions and open source projects to host their work on GitLab.

#### Community Interest 

If you are working on changes to the company, product, or pricing that are expected to have a meaningful impact on members of the wider GitLab community or the GitLab brand, we encourage you to use the label `~Community Interest` so that the Community Relations team can represent the interests of the wider GitLab community in the planning process. 

All members of the Community Relations team should be subscribed to this label in both the [`gitlab-com`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/labels?search=community) and [`gitlab-org`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/labels?search=community) projects.  

#### Team touchpoints 

Our team has a few weekly events that we use to stay connected and aligned on our work: 
- Team meeting on Tuesdays at 1630 GMT
- 1:1 meeting between each team member and their manager
- Three question check-in via Geekbot for each team member on Thursday at 1000 local time with the responses shared in the [#community-hangout](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01C018V7V3) channel


#### Group Conversation
We host a [Group conversation](/handbook/group-conversations/) for the benefit of other team members. 
When posting to the [What's happening at GitLab](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0259241C) Slack to announce a Group Conversation, use the following format to create an engaging and entertaining post. 
```

### Our calendars

We use team-wide calendars for collective notification and to manage team logistics and events. Additionally, specific teams within Community Relations may maintain calendars specific to their programs (such as the [Developer Evangelism calendar](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/#-team-calendar)).

- [Community Relations Team](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y190M2JhY2k5MnFoYnJmYTMyMDdpZHZwdnYwMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

### Community Relations OKRs

Every quarter, we work on [team Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=OKR) that align with company OKRs.

OKRs we seek to align with: 
 * [CEO OKRs](/company/okrs/#most-recent-okrs)
 * [Marketing OKRs](/handbook/marketing/#most-recent-okrs)
 * [Corporate Marketing OKRs](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#most-recent-okrs)

#### How we update our OKRs

To update our [list of current OKRs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=OKR): 
 1. **New Epic.** In order to facilitate [collaboration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration) between the community relations team and the rest of the GitLab teams, OKRs are placed in the [`gitlab-com` project.](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/) The naming convention we use for OKRs is: `FY-Year-Quarter OKR: Description of OKR`
 1. **Program label.** Tag the new epic with a program-specific label (e.g. `open source program` `education program` etc).
 1. **Group label.** Tag the epic with the `community relations` label.
 1. **OKR label.** Add the red `OKR` label.
 
**Issue Health:** We use issue health indicators to help people understand an OKRs status at a glance. These status indicators are: 
 * `on track` 
 * `needs attention` 
 * `at risk`

### Community Relations KPIs
The Community Relations team monitors several [Key Performance Indicators and related Performance Indicators](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/performance-indicators/).

## <i class="fas fa-globe"></i> Community Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging

In alignment with [GitLab's core value of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB)](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion), the Community Relations team seeks to purposefully design DIB into every facet of its programs and operations. We seek to foster DIB at GitLab and within the wider GitLab community.

This section is meant to document tips and best practices that the Community Relations team, and GitLab team, should keep in mind as they plan events and activities.

### Event organization best practices

 * **Tools:** We purposefully think about the tools we are using to engage our audience. For example, some people in the open source world may not be able to use tools that are proprietary software. Also, some people in certain countries may not be able to use certain tools because of country restrictions. Sending a survey beforehand with different tool options could help identify good tools to use for a specific event.
 * **Time zones:** We try to be as inclusive of as many different time zones as possible. It is recommended to have 4 hour segments to spread out participation. Possible times: 16:00 UTC‒20:00 UTC for EMEA and NORAM, and 02:00 UTC‒06:00 UTC for APAC and India.
 * **Code of Conduct:** We make our [Code of Conduct](/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) a requirement at all GitLab events and actively help our community with friction and conflict.
 * **Accessibility:** We advocate for accessibility in all of our events and materials.
 * **Captioning and Interpretation:** Having both captioners and interpreters for online events is important. There are differences in American English and American Sign Language, for example, so captioning alone is not enough. Having a dial-in relay service would work as a "hack" to captions/interpreter, in the worst case scenario. This depends on if the blind person has a video phone/captioned phone to access these services.
 * **Share slides beforehand:** One week before your online event, share the slides with attendees so that people who use screen readers can follow along.
 * **Images should have alt text:** This is for screen readers for people who are blind or are visually impaired. Be descriptive with the image. Maybe a few sentences about what the most important content is.
 * **Use proper headings in your editor:** Use your editor's headings so that screen readers understand the organization of the page.
 * **Introduce yourself descriptively when you give a talk:** In talk intros, briefly describe what you look like so that people who are blind or visually impaired can create a mental image of what you look like and associate that image with your voice.
 * **Schedule breaks with the 30:5 rule:** Make sure to have a 5 min break after each 30 min section.
 * **Describe infographics with audio:** Describe the most important parts of infographics to help with accessibility.
 * **Hybrid events:** Keep having a virtual even option even when in-person begins again!


### Other ways we foster diversity, inclusion, and belonging
 * **Images:** We seek to promote the use of images that represent a diverse group of users, customers, and community members. When we see a lack of diverse representation, we speak up and actively help update those images when possible.
 * **Speakers:** As event organizers and participants, we seek to include a diverse set of speakers in events that GitLab organizes or touches.
 * **We are open-minded:** We actively seek feedback and keep an open mind about our current policies. We are open to change and are willing to make structural changes to ensure that we continue to foster DIB among our team and the wider GitLab community.
 * **We retain a growth-mindset and keep learning:** We read articles, attend workshops, and participate in trainings that help educate us about how to foster DIB in our community and how to be inclusive ourselves.
 * **We encourage a diverse set of community members to participate in research:** We recognize the product inclusivity is important and that we need to build with our community, not just for them. We encourage a divers set of community members to participate in our [First Look product research program](/community/gitlab-first-look/).
 * **We promote the [GitLab Diversity Scholarship program](/community/sponsorship/):** This scholarship supports Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging-focused events financially.

## <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Community Learning Pathway
The [Community Learning Pathway](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-pathway) is a course built to educate the community on how the Community Relations team works, the different community programs and how to contribute the GitLab. Members of the Community and GitLab team members who complete the course will earn a badge.

## <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Community Building Reading Group
The Community Building Reading Group is for GitLab team members interested or engaged in building communities at GitLab. Hosted by members of the Community Relations team, this learning-focused group examines various principles and practices related to imagining, designing, building, nurturing, growing, and supporting communities. Potential topics of study and discussion include:

* Leading and conducting community activities
* Welcoming new contributors
* Managing relationships in and with communities
* Negotiating community authority and power relations
* Architecting and enforcing community codes of conduct
* Cultivating community cultures
* Measuring community health and success
* Converting community participants into community contributors
* Encouraging community mentorship
* Building community-powered innovation and business models
* Assessing community infrastructure and governance models
* Understanding community value propositions and exchanges

By collaborating as part of this group, members aim to:

* **Hone their craft.** Working with communities requires thoughtful and skillful practice. This group provides a space for collectively reviewing, assessing, and learning from materials that help members become better practitioners.
* **Create space for support and growth.** Working with communities requires emotional labor, and people who undertake it often benefit from spaces to discuss the work's challenges with like-minded collaborators. This group would function as one such space.
* **Generate and share resources.** Working with communities is easier with knowledge of best practices and trusted frameworks. By reading and reviewing materials on the state of the art, members generate a knowledge commons others can access and from which they can learn.

Any GitLab team member interested in community building practices is welcome to participate in and contribute to the group. Unlike typical [GitLab book clubs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/book-clubs/), this reading group:

* is an ongoing effort rather than a discrete and time-delimited event
* is focused on a series of works rather than a single one

The reading group operates on a cadence group members determine together. Group members also collectively determine the material—for example, a book chapter, a white paper, a research report, a presentation recording, or a case study—they'll cover each week.

1. Group members propose materials for the group to study and discuss by opening an issue in the Community Relations team's `Community Building` [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/general) using the `reading-group` template, then attaching the `Reading Group::Proposed` label to it. 
2. Group members can then browse one another's suggestions and collectively select what to study. 
3. When they determine what they'll read, they re-label the issue `Reading Group::Up Next.` 
4. When they begin reading and studying proposed material, they re-label the issue, applying the `Reading Group::Now Reading` label.
5. And when they've finished a selection, they apply the `Reading Group::Finished` label to the associated issue. A [project board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/general/-/boards/4595510) tracks all selections.

As they read, group members share notes and impressions asynchronously [via files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/community-building/-/tree/master/resources) stored in the `Community Building` project. When they have completed a selection, they polish these notes and update the `Community Building` wiki accordingly.

Each cycle, a group member (typically the person who proposed the materials) acts as "leader." Group leaders pose some basic discussion questions or thought-generating insights to guide the group's reading and frame its discussion. Group members meet at regular intervals for live, synchronous discussion of the reading materials (suggested time for discussion meetings: 45 minutes). Recordings of these meetings are available, but because discussions often contain personal details and sensitive issues, these recordings are only access to GitLab team members via an internal Google Drive.
