The Community Relations team works from issues and [issue boards](#community-relations-issue-boards). If you need our assistance with any project, please open an issue and use one of the [_main program labels_](#community-relations-labels) anywhere within the GitLab repo.

## Community Relations handbook updates

Merged updates to the handbook are posted to the [#community-relations-fyi](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C015YDXTREK) Slack channel.

MRs must be tagged with the `Community Relations` labeled *before being merged* in order to be posted to Slack. When you create a new MR, be sure to add the label upon creation so this step isn't forgotten. If you are assigned to merge an MR, ensure the label is added prior to merging.

## Community Relations labels

- We track the workflow with the [Marketing Status labels](/handbook/marketing/#boards-and-labels).
- Some programs use [scoped labels in addition](/handbook/marketing/#functional-team-labels).
- Main program labels are defined either at the top `gitlab-com` or the `gitlab-com/marketing` group level to facilitate cross-collaboration and visibility across issue boards

## Community Relations Group Conversation
### What is a Group Conversation (GC)?
GitLab teams update the rest of the company on what they are achieving and working on through [Group Conversations](/handbook/group-conversations/). Group Conversations are an important way to make sure the rest of the organization is aware of what each team is up to, has an opportunity to ask questions, and have a collection of links and information for reference.

### Old Group Conversation decks
The Community Relations team's previous decks are in our [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11c011VkzvSIcS3ko98AbvEP4UcZJmfBk?usp=sharing) (GitLab employees only). It's useful when putting together the next GC deck to look at the last one to make sure that items on the calendar edge don't get missed or included a second time.

### Group Conversation Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)
A DRI from the Community Relations team will be identified for each GC approximately 3 weeks before the next scheduled GC. The DRI should rotate through team members to give everyone a chance to lead the GC. The DRI is responsible for:

- Creating an issue in the [Community Building Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/general) using the [community-relations-group-conversation template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/general/-/issues/new?issuable_template=community-relations-group-conversation).
-  Complete all the tasks in the group conversation template.
-  Prepare a few questions for the team prior to the GC in the case there aren't any questions in the agenda during the GC.
-  Lead the GC.
-  Close the GC issue.
