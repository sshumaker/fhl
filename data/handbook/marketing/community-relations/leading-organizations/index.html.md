## Overview

GitLab's [mission](/company/mission/#mission) is to make it so everyone can contribute. 

The GitLab Leading Organization program supports this mission by recognizing and incentivizing organizations and individuals who are among our most active contributors. This initiative rewards and encourages co-creation. Through this program, we seek to strengthen the open source ecosystem. Leading Organizations drive their company’s innovation and employee retention through contributions while influencing GitLab’s product trajectory. 

Our goal is for 10% of GitLab customers to be Leading Organizations by FY25Q4. This supports our [strategy](/company/strategy/#2-build-on-our-open-core-strength) to grow to 1000 contributors per month.

## Qualification

Definition: A company or individual that reaches 20 merged merge requests or more over a trailing three full calendar month basis. See more about qualification Leading Organizations in the [code review section](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#leading-organizations)

Continued program membership for existing Leading Organizations will be reviewed [quarterly](/handbook/communication/#communicating-dates-and-time).

## Why

Open source is eating the world. The organizations that will stand out as leaders in the next decade are those who understand, embrace,and contribute to open source - building cultures where everyone can contribute.

### Increase Hiring and Retention

Lack of developer talent is one of the biggest threats to businesses. Contributing to open source enables your company to be competitive in a tight market.

1. Highly skilled developers often participate heavily in open source projects and seek out companies with an active open source presence.
1. Public recognition builds employer brand and incentivizes individual employees.
1. Employee satisfaction increases through skill building, training, and knowledge sharing.

### Reduce Cost & Improve Innovation

80% of companies expect to increase their use of enterprise open source software for emerging technologies. [^1]

1. Paying employees to contribute to open source can double the company’s productivity, when compared to non-contributing competitors [^2].
1. Open source saves time and money while increasing efficiency [^3].
1. Consistent contributing enables organizations to replace point solutions faster while reducing technical debt.
