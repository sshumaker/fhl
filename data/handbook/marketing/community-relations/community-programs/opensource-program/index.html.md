Benefits of the GitLab for Open Source Program apply to a namespace. To qualify, every project in an applicant’s namespace must carry an OSI-approved open source license.
{: .alert .alert-info}

#### Qualification exceptions

* **Private Project Exceptions:** In some cases, we allow program members to host a small number of private projects if those projects contain sensitive data. Members should send an email to `opensource@gitlab.com` in order to discuss this exemption. Program members must obtain written permission from the GitLab Open Source Program team in order to use their licenses outside of program requirements.
* **Federal Exception Policy:** Unfortunately, we are not able to accept all open source projects that are affiliated with the US Federal government. Projects that are affiliated must work with a Sales representative to see if they qualify.
* **Strategic Qualification Exceptions:** We may make strategic exceptions to our program requirements. A GitLab Sales team member must make this request on behalf of an open source project. To request an execption, file an issue in the [GitLab for Open Source Program project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/gitlab-for-open-source). Please select the `program-qualification-exception-request` template. when filing the issue. Account Executives and their managers must approve the exception request. Customer Success Managers (CSMs) associated with the account should also be notified of the exception request.

### What are the terms of the GitLab for Open Source Program?

Upon acceptance to the GitLab for Open Source Program, all program members are subject to the [GitLab for Open Source Program Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/opensource-agreement/).

### How does someone apply for the GitLab for Open Source Program?

Applicants should submit the form on the [GitLab for Open Source Program page](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/join/).

As part of the application process, applicants must provide screenshots to confirm their eligibility. They should submit screenshots of:

* The project's license overview
* The project's license contents
* The project's public visibility settings

For more specific instructions on obtaining and submitting required screenshots, [see GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/#gitlab-for-open-source).

### How are GitLab for Open Source Program applications processed?

Gitlab uses SheerID, a trusted partner, to verify that applicants meet the GitLab for Open Source Program requirements. In most cases, applicants receive a decision on their application within three to five business days of submission. During periods of high submission volume, processing an application requires up to ten business days. When verified, applicants receive a verification email containing specific instructions for obtaining their license.

The GitLab for Open Source team processes applications according to the [Community Programs application workflow](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/automated-community-programs/).

### Must members of the GitLab for Open Source Program renew their memberships?

Yes. Program members must renew their memberships annually. If they don’t renew, [their accounts will be downgraded](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/#what-happens-when-my-subscription-is-about-to-expire-or-has-expired).

We recommend that applicants begin the renewal process at least one month in advance of their renewal dates to ensure sufficient processing time. Note that applications will not be processed during U.S. holidays and responses may be delayed during those periods.
{: .alert .alert-warning}

### How does someone renew their membership in the GitLab for Open Soure Program?

To request a renewal, program members should complete the [program application](/solutions/open-source/join/). The team will use this form to determine whether the entity applying for renewal still meets the program's eligibility criteria. Whether applying to the program for the first time or renewing a pre-existing membership, applicants complete the same form.

The person claiming the renewal for the subscription must be the same person who created the subscription for this open source project or organization in the GitLab Customer Portal. If a different person wishes to initiate the renewal, the existing owner needs to [transfer ownership of the Customers Portal account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/#change-account-owner-information). If the existing owner is no longer able to transfer ownership or renew, the project should [open a support ticket](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000071293) to change the owner of the subscription before initiating renewal.
{: .alert .alert-danger}

After completing application form, verified applicants receive a verification email with instructions to obtain their subscription licenses.

### How else can GitLab assist open source projects?

Members of the GitLab for Open Source Program may also be interested in:

* **Migration services:** Open source communities requiring assistance with their migration to GitLab can receive help from the GitLab team. See the [professional services page](/services/) for more information.
* **Technology partners:** Many of GitLab's [technology partners](/partners/technology-partners/) offer services GitLab doesn't provide, such as hosting for Community Edition instances. We've partnered with others to help expand the options for our users. Browse our [GitLab Alliance Partners](/partners/technology-partners/) to learn more.

# GitLab Open Source Partners

The [GitLab Open Source Partners](/solutions/open-source/partners/) program exists to build relationships with prominent open source projects using GitLab as a critical component of their infrastructure. By building these relationships, GitLab hopes to strengthen the open source ecosystem.

Open source partners receive [specific benefits](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/opensource-program/#what-are-the-benefits-of-being-a-member-of-the-gitlab-open-source-partners-program) by joining the program. GitLab benefits from these partnerships when open source partners provide valuable feedback and data on their use of GitLab, even contribute to GitLab's open core. All parties jointly benefit when they're able to collaborate on community outreach, co-marketing, joint announcements, and special initiatives.

## FAQs

### What are the benefits of being a member of the GitLab Open Source Partners program?

Program members receive:

* Public recognition as a GitLab Open Source Partner
* Direct line of communication to GitLab
* Assistance migrating additional infrastructure to GitLab
* Exclusive invitations to participate in GitLab events
* Opportunities to meet with and learn from other open source partners
* Visibility and promotion through GitLab marketing channels

### What are the requirements for being a member of the GitLab Open Source Partners program?

Members of the GitLab Open Source Partners program agree to:

* Engage in co-marketing efforts with GitLab
* Complete a public case study about their innovative use of GitLab
* Plan and participate in joint initiatives and events

### Who qualifies for the GitLab Open Source Partners program?

While most partners are also members of the GitLab for Open Source Program, not all are (as some partners are commercial open source entities and therefore ineligible for the program). Most partners use GitLab Ultimate (either SaaS or self-managed); however, some prefer using the fully open source [Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/) because of their strong commitment to using only open source tools.

Membership in GitLab Open Source Partners program is largely by invitation. Members of the open source program team extend invitations to longtime members of the GitLab for Open Source Program, projects using GitLab in interesting and innovative ways from which others can learn, or projects with large communities and brand recognition already using GitLab for everyday operations.

Additionally, GitLab team members can nominate open source projects or organizations to become partners. To do so, they can simply open an issue in the [Open Source Partners Program project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program) and use the `open-source-partner-nomination` issue template.

The GitLab Open Source Partners Program project contains sensitive data and personally identifying information about program members. It is therefore accessible only to GitLab team members.
{: .alert .alert-info}

## Program management resources

### Managing projects

Work on the GitLab Open Source Partners program occurs in two primary locations:

* [GitLab Open Source Partners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners), a **public group** and the default location for program activity. Program members receive access to the project and `Developer`-level persmission inside it. It's the place where program members, GitLab team memebers, and the wider open source community can interact, collaborate, share, and build.
* [Open Source Partners Program](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program), a **private project** accessible only to GitLab team members. This project is private because it contains sensitive personal data pertaining to open source partners and features a private service desk exclusively for GitLab Open Source Partners working on non-public issues. See the [Community Relations Program Management handbook section](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/project-management/) to learn more.

### Welcoming new partners

We maintain [email templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/tree/master/templates) to help us interact with prospective and current partners. When an organization has joined the GitLab Open Source Partners program, we send a comprehensive [program guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners/community-resources/-/blob/main/program-guide/gitlab-open-source-partners-program-guide.pdf).

### Collecting and managing partner contact details

We maintain a confidential, non-public [register of our partners' contact details](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/open-source-partners-program/-/tree/master/current-partners) so we can remain connected to them.

When partners join the program, we instruct them to submit key community contact information to the private partner service desk at `ospartners@gitlab.com`. The Open Source Program Manager responds to these requests and updates internal documentation.

We periodically request updated contact information from partners to ensure we remain connected to the proper community representatives.

We try to maintain partner registries containing the following community contacts:

* **Primary:** The person representing the project and/or community at meetings and serving as our principal connection to the project.
* **Alternate:** The person we can contact if we're unable to reach the primary contact.
* **Marketing:** The person we contact when partner event and marketing opportunities arise.
* **Technical:** The person we contact regarding participation in surveys or focus studies that require technical expertise, or when something at GitLab may require input from technical contacts at open source partner organizations.
* **Legal:** (optional) The person we contact to weigh in on legal matters, such as updates to terms of service agreements, partnership activities, or permission to use a project's logo.

### Renewing and extending partner subscriptions

Members of the GitLab Open Source Partners program who are also members of the GitLab for Open Source Program may be eligible for an extended-period subscription. The current extended subscription renewal period is **36 months**.

Partners seeking extended-period renewals should email their requests to opensource@gitlab.com. If the request is urgent, please include `[Urgent]` in the email's subject line. Partners should use this template to format their requests:

```
Subject: Open Source Partner (Application/Renewal)
Subscription Term: 36
Number of seats you are requesting: 
The license type to be issued (Self-Managed or SaaS): 
List any change of ownership to the account: 
(If account ownership details change, please send the new account holder's name, email address, and contact's mailing address)
```

When a request is processed and accepted, applicants will be asked to sign a $0 quote with a 36-month term. After that:

- For **Saas**: No further action is necessary.
- For **Self-managed**: Applicants need to download licenses from the GitLab Customer Portal and upload them to their instances.

### Tracking partner issues

Gitlab's open source partners requesting support track most of their issues publicly. They do this via issue trackers located in the [GitLab Open Source Partners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners) group—most commonly the [Community Support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues) project. Here, fellow open source partners partners and GitLab team members can collaborate on supporting GitLab's open source partners.

Often, partners wish to open issues related to their work migrating infrastructure from legacy infrastructure to GitLab (for instance, note examples from [KDE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/7), [Drupal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/4), and [Freedesktop.org](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/open-source-program/gitlab-open-source-partners/community-support/-/issues/9)). To create migration-focused issues, partners can use the `open-source-partner-migration` issue template.

### Sharing partner stories

The GitLab Open Source Partners program is a commuinity-focused marketing effort designed to highlight ways high-profile open source communities are using—and succeeding with—GitLab. As such, we aim to share partner stories whenever possible.

We do this in many ways, including:

* posts on the GitLab blog
* case studies for GitLab.com
* webcasts and webniars for GitLab's video channels
* event showcases and presentations

When we publish new partner-related stories, we link to them on the GitLab Open Source Partners [program page](/solutions/open-source/partners/) and the GitLab for Open Source [solutions page](/solutions/open-source/partners/).

We often connect with partners when we feel we can help them share stories related to:

* Their plans to migrate infrastructure to GitLab
* Their success at migrating infrastructure to GitLab
* Their innovative use of GitLab to build something notatble or solve a tehnical/social challenge for their project and community
* Their resolution of critical technical challenges that align with themes central to other GitLab marketing campaigns (e.g., CI/CD, security, or project management)

### Adding a new logo to the Open Source Partners program page

Our Open Source Partners are shown on the [Open Source Partners](/solutions/open-source/partners) page and the main [GitLab for Open Source program](/solutions/open-source/) page. These are the steps to add a new logo to those sections.

**Step 1: Add a new org to the Organizations list**

You'll need to add an entry to the [`data/organizations.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/organizations.yml) file using GitLab's WebIDE.

Follow this format (you can copy and paste it at the bottom of the organizations.yml file):

```markdown
- name: ORG NAME
  logo: /images/organizations/logo_ORG NAME.svg
  logo_color: /images/organizations/logo_ORG NAME_color.svg
  industry_type: 'open source software'
  home_url:
  landing: false
  opensource_partner: true
```

Example:

```markdown
- name: Inkscape
  logo: /images/organizations/logo_inkscape.svg
  logo_color: /images/organizations/logo_inkscape_color.svg
  industry_type: 'open source software'
  home_url: https://inkscape.org
  landing: false
  opensource_partner: true
```

**Step 2: Prep the logos**

First, create two SVGs: one color, one grey:

1. **Get an SVG.** Make sure you have an SVG file. If you weren't provided with one, look for a vector (`*.svg`) version of the logo in the official channels (e.g. the [ARM trademarks page](https://www.arm.com/company/policies/trademarks/guidelines-corporate-logo) has SVG as one of the download options). If you can't find the SVG file on their channels, you may need to Google it and find one on Wikimedia Commons. Download the original file.
1. **Duplicate SVG and name each copy.** Duplicate the file and name each of the two files as follows:
     * `logo_ORG Name.svg` -- Example: `logo_inkscape.svg`. This will be the greyscale image that will be shown on the customer reference page.
     * `logo_ORG Name_color.svg` -- Example: `logo_inkscape_color.svg`. This will be the color image that displays on the Open Source Partners page.
1. **Create greyscale logo.** These instructions are specifically for using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) as the image editor, which you can download for free for most operating systems, including Mac.
     * Open the SVG image with Inkscape.
     * In the top menu, go to `Filters` -> `Color` -> `Greyscale`. Click on `Live Preview` so you can see what will happen. Save your changes.
     * Export the logo and make sure that it is called: `logo_ORG Name.svg` as detailed above.

If you are not using Inkscape, aim for getting a greyscale image with Hex Color Code: Dark Grey `#444444` and then export the greyscale logo as an SVG with a transparent background.
{: .alert .alert-info}

Next, optimize the SVGs both color and grey logos:

1. Go to this SVG optimization website: https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ and upload one of the logos
1. Make sure that the `Prefer viewBox to width/height` factor is toggled `On`. It should be near the bottom of the list of optimization factors.
1. Export the SVG and save

**Step. 3: Upload the logo via WebIDE**

1. Go to `source/images/organizations` and upload the two prepped logos

Once you've completed these steps, check to make sure that the pipleline works, and check out the preview.

**Step 4: Review the changes**

Unfortunately, the review app will not automatically allow you to preview the new page. The app typically detects which files have been changed, and then creates a URL, or a set of URLs, pointing to the built pages with the changes. Since this type of merge request (adding a new logo to the open source partners page), does not change any HTML files, the View App does not know where to point to. It defaults to the GitLab home page.

Here's how to generate a link to preview the changes:

Since the `View App` points to the GitLab home page for this build as mentioned above, we need to add the path to the webpage you'd like to preview.

To do this, you need to be familiar with four parts of the View App URL:

1. **The beginning of the URL:** `https://` -- it doesn't include "www"
1. **Your branch name:** You can copy this from your Merge Request (MR) in the "Request to Merge" section directly under the MR description.
1. **The View App snippet:** `.about.gitlab-review.app` -- this is what builds the preview
1. **The path to the webpage you'd like to preview:** This is everything after "about.gitlab.com/" on the webpage you're editing

Example:

1. `https://`
1. `c_hupy-master-patch-24835` (branch name)
1. `.about.gitlab-review.app`
1. `/solutions/open-source/partners` (path to the webpage I want to preview)

This formula creates: `https://c_hupy-master-patch-24835.about.gitlab-review.app/solutions/open-source/partners`. This link allows you to preview the MR changes for the `c_hupy-master-patch-24835` branch on the GitLab Open Source Partners page.

For ease of use, here's the formula:
```
`https://` [your branch] `.about.gitlab-review.app` [rest of the path to the page you want to build]
```

You should now be able to create preview links when the View App doesn't work!

If your pipeline is green, ask someone to review and merge!

# Consortium Memberships and Sponsorships

GitLab's open source program team also oversees GitLab's representation and participation in select industry consortia, as well as GitLab's sponsorship of select open source community events.

## FAQs

### What is a consortium?

We define "consortium" as a group createdto further some technological cause. In the context of open source software, a prototypical consortium would be the [Linux Foundation (LF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation), a non-profit organization founded in 2000 as a merger between Open Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group, which [hosts and promotes](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/) collaborative development of open source software projects.

### Why is consortium marketing important?

Consortia are influential leaders in their respective ecosystems, as they often host conferences and underwrite programs that influence global conversations about particular technological developments. Participating in consortia enhances GitLab's brand—and helps align GitLab's engineering efforts with global efforts and trends.

### How does GitLab particpate in consortium activities?

While select consortium memberships fall within the purview (and budget) of GitLab's open source program, the [Developer Evangelism team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/) focuses on consortium marketing, working to integrate GitLab's overall community message and technical perspective into the most appropriate and effective industry conversations.

### How can I recommend GitLab get involved in a consortium?

You can open an issue in the [Consortium Memberships project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/consortium-memberships). When you do, please use the `membership-evaluation` template to structure your issue. Open source program team members will evaluate your application using the following criteria. When we review the application, we'll assess it with these considerations in mind:

* Awareness opportunities
* Ease of collaboration
* Contribution and hiring pool

| Considerations | What we're interested in | Questions we're asking |
| --------------| ------------------ | -----------------------------|
| Awareness opportunities | Size of the organization<br /><br />Frequency and impact of marketing opportunities<br /><br />| How many authenticated and non-authenticated users are visiting organization's website monthly?<br /><br />How many people are part of the organization’s community?<br /><br />What sorts of marketing and communication channels (social media platforms, newsletters, blogs, events) does the organization use?<br /><br /> Will GitLab appear in those official channels? How prominent would our placement be? |
| Ease of collaboration | Access to a dedicated marketing resources/point person<br /><br />Time-to-execute for standard communication types | Does the organization have marketing capacity?<br /><br />How mature is the organization's brand and marketing portions?<br /><br />How quickly can this organization produce a resource (e.g., a case study)? A week? A month? A quarter?<br /><br />How responsive is the person in charge of the relationship?<br /><br />Is marketing handled by volunteers or paid employees? |
| Contribution and hiring pool | Size of contributor/member base<br /><br />Overall community/member activity<br /><br />Frequency of community contribution<br /><br />Rate of adoption | How active is the community the organization is attempting to foster?<br /><br /> Does the organization have a sense of its community's health?<br /><br />Do we see hiring opportunities opportunities to recruit from the community's talent pool?<br /><br />What is the growth of the community or foundation itself?<br /><br />Do we see job opportunities within that software ecosystem (are people hiring contributors from this community in general)?<br /><br />How can GitLab contribute in ways that align with our interests?<br /><br />Can GitLab participate in the project's roadmap in ways that creates mutual value? |

### In which consortia is GitLab involved?

We are currently members of the following consortia:

* [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/)
* [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org/)
* [InnerSource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/)
* [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)
* [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/)
* [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/)

[Complete details of GitLab's activities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/consortium-memberships) with these groups are available in the `Consortium Memberships` project. Note that because this project contains sensitive data and personally identifying information, it is only accessible to GitLab team members.

## Program management resources

### Elections for Board of Directors opportunities

Some of the consortia in which we participate allow members to run for their respective Boards of Directors. Anyone interested in becoming more involved in any of the consortia GitLab supports should visit the `Consortium Memberships` [project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/consortium-memberships) and open an issue.

Review the information below if you're thinking of seeking nomination for (or election to) consortium positions.

**Internal nominations** \
Create an issue for each nomination so GitLab team members who are also interested in running can discuss, and so additional internal nominations can occur. Community Relations, Alliances, and Marketing leadership (CMO, Director of Corporate Marketing) teams will likely be involved. Prepare a [nomination statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IrtEBGfjuwi8Tz87U0vOsCxN9-f2-Krt1t-db87nyzU/edit?ts=60c13066#heading=h.5tbh3ex4b8al) that explains your interest in joining the board. Post this as part of your issue so our internal teams can help you polish it.

**Campaigning** \
Once GitLab candidates are nominated, the Community Relations team can help them campaign for their positions. We'll make other GitLab team members  aware of the election and equip them to assist your campaign, too (e.g., by announcing the campaign on the `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` Slack channel).

**Promoting** \
The social media team is able to promote elections notification news. They simply need a place to point people, preferably an updated webpage that lists the board of directors or a social media post from the organization that mentions the election results.

### Event sponsorships

GitLab's open source program maintains a small budget for sponsorship of events that allow GitLab to engage with open source communities. We typically allocate this budget for local and regional community-driven events that GitLab's corporate events and field marketing teams have not already agreed to sponsor and staff. We prefer to sponsor events at which multiple open source projects and communities are present.

The open source program team tracks event partication in the `Open Source Marketing` [project on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/open-source-marketing). To suggest an open source event sponsorship, open an issue in this project and use the `event` issue template to file your request.

Event organizers and consortium leads working with GitLab will find GitLab's brand-related assets (such as logo files, press release boilerplate, and trademark information) in [GitLab's press kit](https://about.gitlab.com/press/press-kit/).

# Measuring our success

Our team measures the success of our work in the following ways.

## Program enrollment

The GitLab for Open Source Program can only succeed when it serves a growing and satisfied body of members. We therefore track program enrollment closely using the [Open Source Program dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-intermediate-dashboard/986208/Open-Source-Program) on Sisense. The dashboard reports the number of unique licenses we've issued as part of the program, the number of unique projects enrolled in the program, our annual renewal rate, and more.

This dashboard pulls data from Salesforce. GitLab team members with access to Salesforce can view [a custom report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008mhmV) for more detail on program accounts.
