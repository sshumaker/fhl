# Overview
This page holds the email templates used to interact with people who are intereted in our community programs ([GitLab for Education](/solutions/education/), [GitLab for Open Source](/solutions/open-source/), [GitLab for Startups](/solutions/startups/).

Since we interact with program members and applicants mainly via Zendesk, we have created Zendesk macros for most emails we need to send.

The macros below are organized into the various stages of our [community programs application workflow](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/#application-workflow).

### Using Gmail as an alternative to Zendesk

We use Zendesk to interface with our community in most cases.

However, in some cases, like when you need to loop in a Sales representative, you may need to send an email from your Gmail inbox instead. That's why this page mainly holds Zendesk macros, but also includes email templates at the end.

When sending from your Gmail account, be sure to send these emails from the education@gitlab.com / opensource@gitlab.com / startups@gitlab.com email alias. To configure your inbox, [follow these instructions](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/workflows-tools/e-mail/#setting-up-aliases) or take a look at [the official GMail documentation](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en).

If you end up using Gmail on a regular basis, consider adding the relevant templates to your Gmail inbox by [enabling templates and creating a template](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308990?hl=en).

### Community program workflows and common tasks
Since this page is part of the community program application workflow, the following pages hold more context on when to use each of the macros and email templates:

 * [Community program workflows](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/) - this page holds the application workflow for the community programs.
 * [Common tasks](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/common-tasks/) - this page holds common requests, tasks, and errors related to the community applicaiton workflow.


# Zendesk Macros and Email Templates

A [Zendesk macro](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/workflows-tools/zendesk/#zendesk-macros) is essentially an email template that allows you to send messages that are often used.

Below are Zendesk macros that are regularly used when communicating with community program participants. We have mapped them out to match the various phases of the [community program workflows](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/#application-workflow).

Not everyone at GitLab can access the [Community Zendesk instance](https://gitlab-community.zendesk.com/), so this page is meant to document all of the Zendesk macros we use. This provides transparency around our messaging, and it also allows others to integrate with our workflows.

Below, you'll find macros that are program specific. Macros which span multiple programs are designated as "Common Requests."

## Zendesk Macros - the basics
### How to send a Zendesk Macro
1. Choose an appropriate macro from the `Apply Macro` dropdown at the bottom of the page.
1. Add the name of the contact to the salutation `Hi {NAME}` if it hasn't been added automatically. The contact's name is generally found in the Zendesk ticket or in the Salesforce record.
1. Read through the macro. Fill in or change any details needed.
1. Add your name to the close if it hasn't been automatically populated. e.g. `Best Regards, {YOUR NAME}`.
1. Check tags to make sure you're including the correct ones, and send!

### How to edit or add a new Zendesk Macro
If you'll need to send a message more than once, consider creating a Zendesk macro to save time. When creating or editing a new macro, make sure to document it on this page.

[Here's how to edit or create Zendesk Macros](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/workflows-tools/zendesk/#zendesk-macros).

### Handling Zendesk Ticket Status

Use the following guidelines when processing tickets for all programs.

| Ticket Details | Ticket Status and Actions Needed |
| ----- | ----- |
| License issue or legal case that needs follow up | `open` ticket |
| Need follow up from another individual or program manager | `open` ticket + tag a teammate in the ticket and post in the #community-programs Slack channel for support |
| Waiting on the customer to respond to a ticket | `pending` ticket |
| No response is needed or expected | `solved` ticket |
| Adding notes to the ticket to address later | `new` ticket + leave internal notes |

# Common Requests - Zendesk Macros

The following Zendesk macros are meant to help you interface with people interested in one of our community programs. We've designated them as common requests because they can be used for multiple programs.

For more context on when to send them, please reference the [Community program workflow page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/).

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

We have received your application for the GitLab for Open Source program.

In order to process your application and decide whether your project qualifies for the program, we need more information.

Please send the following:
 * Link to your GitLab profile page (e.g. gitlab.com/username)
 * Link to your project or group's namespace so that we can verify that it is publicly visible and accessible (e.g. gitlab.com/project)
 * Link to a license file within your project or group with an [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) license

We recognize that people applying to this program may not have everything set up on GitLab yet, but we require some minimum set up to occur so that we can verify that the project meets our program's requirements.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thank you,

{{current_user.first_name}}

### OSS:: OSI-approved license

| Metadata | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Description | Qualification Phase: Ask them to add OSI-approved licenses to their project |
| Available for | All Agents |
| Actions | `Add:Comment/Description` `Add tags: troubleshooting` `Status: Pending` |

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

Thank you for applying to the GitLab for Open Source program!

I see that you have linked to an OSI-approved license in your application, but you'll need to apply it to each project in your group before we're able to proceed. It should be added to the LICENSE file so that it shows up in the overview section of the project. This allows contributors to see it at a glance.

It's best to copy and paste the entire license into the file in its original form. Here is an example of a project you can refer to: https://gitlab.com/BuildGrid.

Unfortunately, it'll default to "All rights reserved" if there's no license file mentioned, so you'll need to ensure that you add the correct license to each project within your group.

Please let us know once you've updated the license file for all of your projects and we'll happily proceed considering your application.

Best regards,

{{current_user.first_name}}

### OSS:: Clarifying "not-seeking-profit" req and Qualification Examples

| Metadata | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Description | Qualification Phase: Send this if you need to clarify our non-profit requirement or provide qualification examples |
| Available for | All Agents |
| Actions | `Add:Comment/Description` `Add tags: OSS` |

Hello {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

Thank you for reaching out.

Can you please clarify your use case? Our goal is to support open source projects that do not have a dedicated income (donations are ok). If someone is developing an open source project and charging for services around that or charging for higher tiers that include the core open source project, we classify them as a company, and we're unable to provide our top tiers for free to them at this time.

I'm including more information below on some qualification criteria that helps guide our decision for granting free licenses. Please let me know if you have any questions. If you no longer qualify, we can help connect you with a sales representative so that they can help you find a solution for your use case.

Best,

{{current_user.first_name}}

----
**Examples of OSS projects that usually qualify:**
_Receives Donations_ -- The software is being developed by a community that gathers donations for covering costs.

_Has an open governance model_ -- Projects with open governance models are likely to be accepted. For more information about open governance models, see this [open source governance model article](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models). The only model in there that would NOT qualify is the corporate governance model.

**Examples that usually do not qualify:**
_Open Core_ -- The software is being primarily developed by a company that uses the software for its core or base product. The company charges for use of the software at higher tiers.

_Charging for Services_ -- The software itself is not being sold but the open source project is being primarily developed by a company that charges for services around that open source project.

### OSS:: Qualification error, OSS federal exception rejection, and sales intro

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},

I apologize for the confusion, but as your case was being reviewed, someone caught something that I didn't catch: we have a Federal exception to our program, which means you do not qualify for the Open Source Program after all.

We periodically reassess our program offerings, so if you'd like to stay up-to-date with the latest community-related announcements, like this topic, we encourage you to "watch" the Newsletter subcategory on our forum: https://forum.gitlab.com/c/community/newsletter/5

I am happy to be able to connect you with a sales representative to discuss licensing options that will work best for your specific use case. I have CCed [ADD SALES REP NAME HERE] on this email communication. They will likely reach out in order to discuss how best to get you what you need.

I will go ahead and mark this ticket as 'solved' for now, but if you need anything at all, or if you have questions, simply reply to this thread and we will be here to help.

Best,

# Non-profits Program (not active yet)
We are currently exploring the creation of a non-profit program ([see handbook page](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/education-program/) with more info). In the meantime, these responses help us respond to inquiries about the program's status.


### Email Response to request from Sales
Hello {NAME},

Thanks for reaching out. This certainly does look like an interesting non-profit. Unfortunately, they do not qualify for any of our existing programs.

We currently do not have a formal non-profit program. Non-profit subscriptions are rarely granted as of now, and generally, the ones that are granted have a champion or approval from the E-group or Sales leadership. If you are able to obtain such support, we are able to help issue the license.

[Here](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/education-program/) is our handbook link.  Please let me know if you have any questions. At this time, I would recommend that they follow the issue in that handbook page and stay tuned. We hope to have more progress on this in the coming months.

We are happy to send our [template non-profit](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/community-program-applications/email-and-zendesk-macros/) response if you'd like.

Best Regards,

{YOUR NAME}

Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},,

Thanks for your interest in GitLab and for sharing your amazing efforts with us! Unfortunately, at this time, the work you explained, does not qualify for one of our existing free programs([GitLab for Open Source](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/), [GitLab for Education](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/), and  [GitLab for Startups](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/startups/)).

We would absolutely love to support non-profit organizations, and are actively working towards doing so in the future! I hope you understand that we see the value in the work that you do, but our bandwidth is currently full with our existing programs. Please stay tuned on our [non-profit issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/education-program/general/-/issues/17) and please feel free to add feedback for us.

In the meantime, please consider [signing up](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) for one of our free-tiers (SaaS or Self-Managed). That way we still get to work together.

Best regards,

{{current_user.first_name}}
