### Credits

ZoomInfo credits represent the consumption (export) of a professional or company profile from the ZoomInfo platform. This export can originate from the primary ZoomInfo platform, the ReachOut Chrome Extension, or any time an API call is made from any number of our integrations, including CRMs, marketing automation platforms, and sales automation tools. 

-   **Users** -  Monthly credits are set at 1,000 and bulk credits are set at 2,000. 
Each user has 1,000 monthly credits to use for prospecting. A credit is consumed any time a user exports a contact or company out of the platform. These credits reset on the first of each month. When a user pushes "export" it should automatically pull from the monthly credits until a user has utilized all 1,000 of their monthly credits. After those monthly credits are consumed you are then able to use the bulk credits. Bulk credits are adjustable. Monthly credits are not. A user also has 2,000 views in which they can use to click on a contact and view/unlock the contact information.
-   **Accounts** - Max number of accounts a user can export to SFDC is set to 100.
-   **Contacts** - Max number of contacts a user can export to SFDC must match accounts and is set to 100. This is because contacts MUST be associated with accounts in SFDC. When exporting a contact, Zoominfo will check to see if an Account exists within SFDC that matches the company the contact works at. If not, users can create a new account which they will associate the contact to. Enforcing that contact creation is equal to or less than accounts is to make sure there is not a scenario where a contact export fails because they are unable to create the same number of accounts.
-   **Leads** - Max number of leads a user can export to SFDC is set at 1,000. This ensures that the user will not max out their monthly allotment in one export.
-   **Bulk requests** If a bulk download is needed for a campaign, please open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new) for the marketing operations project. Admins have unlimited credits to be able to export bulk lists or a temporary lift can be made for individual users.
-   **Reporting bad leads** - If a lead is found to be incorrect the user can submit a `Suggest Contact Update` and the research team will usually update it within 1-2 business days. When the lead is updated the user can manually append it or re-push the prospect into SFDC without expending a credit (for two months while it's "under management").
-   **API Credits**- Leads, Contacts & Accounts are being enriched [as detailed below](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/zoominfo/#sfdc-account-enrichment) and an API Credit is used everytime the webhook is called (1 per lead/contac/account), regardless of how many fields, on that particlar record, are updated.

### Field Mappings
All current field mappings are documented [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lZ2BgNER_OYR5jjYDHreCMRbpODQbprUpGKVRD5TMnY/edit#gid=504148174). 
Custom fields start with [ZI] and will be visible in the Zoominfo section in SFDC. Example name: `[ZI] Company Phone`. All [ZI] fields are set to be able to overwrite the field should new data be available on a lead, contact, or account. The only information mapped to standard fields are fields needed for basic lead, contact, or account creations. Example: `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `Email Address`.

### SFDC Native Integration
- The Salesforce Native App is available on any lead, contact, or account directly within SFDC. 
- The Salesforce Native App only allows users to export 25 at a time. Where as logging in directly and using the standard Salesforce web connector allows you to push up to 2,000 at a time - for any bulk pushes it is recommended you use the normal ZoomInfo website.

## SFDC Account Enrichment
All the SFDC accounts are enriched and re-enriched with Zoominfo on a daily basis. Instant Enrich is turned on and will enrich any new accounts upon creation.

## SFDC Lead Enrichment

All leads in SFDC are enriched on a monthly basis on the third Friday. 

In addition to leads beeing enriched on a monthly basis, we have just turned on Instant Enrich for Leads (Nov. 17th 2022) and all net new leads are getting enriched as they reach SFDC. 

As a back-up job, in case Instant Enrich job fails, we're keeping live the Scheduled Enrich for net new leads that takes place on a daily basis to make sure the sales teams have the most up to date information. 

## SFDC Contact Enrichment

All contacts in SFDC are enriched on a monthly basis on the third Friday. 

## Campaign Member Enrichment (Leads & Contacts) 

Zoominfo Campaign Member Enrichment can achieved via Scheduled Enrich with List Views and Enrichment Jobs for both Leads & Contacts 

To do this, follow the steps below:
- Mark the leads & contacts with the use of an operational field like **MktgOPS_C**
- Create Lead List Views & Contact List Views and filter using the operational field;
- Create & Schedule Zoominfo enrichment jobs for both leads & contacts and select enrichment via the list views created at the previous step. 

### Outreach Integration
The ZoomInfo Outreach integration is now live and you may export contacts directly to Outreach. Any contacts you do export, will also be exported in SFDC. They will be initially missing some ZI information in SFDC but there will be an append job that will run automatically to update any missing information.

 There are some limitations in place:

- There is a 100 contact export limit in place.
- We do not allow for new accounts/account updates from ZoomInfo into Outreach. 
- Please do not upload any contact without an email address into Outreach- if you do, the prospect will not sync into SFDC and any activities you do on the prospect will not be recorded in SFDC. 

Any prospects created without email address will be found and deleted in the Outreach database management we will run monthly. To avoid uploading contacts with no email addresses, please use the ZoomInfo filtering available.

### Marketo Integration
The Marketo integration is utilizing ZoomInfo's **Enrich** product. This is done on an automated basis utilizing a webhook.

Marketo/ZoomInfo webhook is triggered, on form-fill, when the person record fills the forms below (on an ongoing/future basis):
1. Filled out a SaaS Trial form;
1. Filled out a Self-managed Trials form;
1. Filled out Contact Us form. 

Enrich is mostly set to enrich the ZoomInfo fields. The ZoomInfo ([ZI]) fields, will have their values overwritten with the most up to date information. The other standard fileds like `Employees Bucket` or other Marketo standard fields like (First Name, Last Name, Job Title) are getting enriched only if the information is missing.
