### About Typeform

Typeform makes collecting and sharing information comfortable and conversational. It's a web based platform you can use to create anything from surveys to apps, without needing to write a single line of code. 

### Access

On our current plan with Typeform, there can only be 1 shared login. To request access, post a Slack message to `#mktgops`. 

### Creating a Typeform for use on about.gitlab.com

Once you've created your Typeform and ready to create a landing page on the marketing website, it's time to generate your embed code. 

When you're creating your embed code, make sure to choose the ["standard" size](https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029249212-Embed-your-typeform). Using other sizes will result in the Typeform not displaying correctly in the template we have designated for Typeform landing pages.

### Data Deletion Process 

In order to maintain compliance and reduce risk, survey data will be stored in Typeform for 12 months. After 12 months, survey data will be moved to [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12L0ru1xkVay8iq862mXtXgTanFT_EZ7e?usp=sharing). Survey data will be audited and moved to the Google drive folder quarterly.
