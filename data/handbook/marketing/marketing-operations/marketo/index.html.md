### About Marketo

[Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) is our marketing automation platform used for email marketing, lead management, and program management. 



## Marketo Tech Stack Guide

Visit the [Marketo Tech Stack Guide](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/tech-stack-guide-marketo/#integrations) for more information around provisioning, integrations and system diagrams.



### Marketo <> Salesforce.com Connection

When any lead/contact is created in SFDC, it will automatically sync and create in Marketo - nothing is held back. Likewise, when a lead/contact is deleted in SFDC, it will delete in Marketo as well. 

Alternatively, Marketo does not automatically push all records to SFDC and a deleted record in Marketo will not delete in SFDC unless specifically told to. 

A lead will sync from Marketo to SFDC in these scenarios:
1. Member of Program that is synced to SFDC
1. When a person reaches `Inquiry` status
2. When they reach `MQL` status and reach 100 points
3. Specifically told to sync via a flow step `Sync to SFDC`

Data is shared between the two via the Marketo User Permission Set with either `Read` or `Read/Write` permissons. Accounts fields by default are `Read Only`. Here are quick links to review them:
- [Leads](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0PS4M000001136E?s=EntityPermissions&o=Lead)
- [Contacts](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0PS4M000001136E?s=EntityPermissions&o=Contact)
- [Accounts](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0PS4M000001136E?s=EntityPermissions&o=Account)


Marketo also can create and edit SFDC campaigns. The `Active` checkbox must be checked in order for Marketo to be able to map to that campaign. [Go here for campaign set up directions](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#marketo-program-and-salesforce-campaign-set-up).

When large updates are made to an SFDC field value, they could cause a sync backlog back to Marketo. To check the backlog, go to [this page](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/supportTools/sfdcSyncStats) and select the object you want to review and click `Get Stats`. Marketo>SFDC is a push count, while SFDC>Marketo is considered Pull. You must be logged in to Marketo to view this information. Backlogs clear automatically, they are slower during working hours due to system usage (Marketo's user base, not just GitLab), but the sync speeds up off-hours and on weekends.

### Custom Sync Rules with Salesforce
Because certain processes create records with a blank email address in SFDC we want to avoid having those records flowing into Marketo since they are not actionable and the database has increasing costs per the number of records.

Together with Sales Systems, we implemented a custom formula field called `Block_Marketo_Sync__c`. When the field is checked, records will be blocked from syncing by the custom sync rule. Likewise, when the field is unchecked, it will flow to Marketo.

For the sandbox, we have a different set of [syncing rules](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#sandbox).


### Multi-thread Sync

To avoid or clear SFDC backlogs, multi-thread sync is availible to use in Marketo. It enables the use of multiple lanes of data flowing from SFDC to Marketo, greatly increasing the sync rate depending on the resources availible on the Marketo servers. Each record in Marketo is marked with a value between `1-9` on the field `Marketo Thread ID` based on the first letter of the email address. Records will be synced and distributed on threads based on the value of `Marketo Thread ID`.

| Letter | Value |
| ------ | ------ |
| A B | 1 |
| D E F | 2 |
| G H I | 3 |
| J K L | 4 | 
| M N O | 5 |
| P Q R | 6 | 
| S T U | 7 |
| V W X | 8 |
| Y Z C | 9 |

**NB: This feature is not always-on and only Marketo Support can enable it. A support ticket must be opened with 7 days before planning any massive updates from SFDC or at any time there is a significant backlog**

#### Enabling Multi-Thread Sync
To enable, you must [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-marketo-multithread) 7 days in advance with the Marketing Operations team and include the following, so that we can open the ticket with Marketo.
1. Anticipated date of mass update
1. Business impact
1. Which field(s) are updating that will result in a backlog

### Sandbox
We do have a sandbox to work in for Marketo. The sandbox is used for training, creation of API links and overall testing before we move to production. There is not a way to `promote` a program from the sandbox to Prod, so building programs in the sandbox first is not always required. Guidelines for when to build in the sandbox is TBD, but for custom API and webhook integrations, it is highly recommended.

If you'd like access to the sandbox, please fill out an [AR](/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/frequently-asked-questions/).

To limit the number of leads that pass from SFDC staging to Marketo Sandbox, we have instituted a custom rule that will only allow leads to sync from SFDC Staging to Marketo Sandbox IF `Marketo Sync` = TRUE. This is opposite logic than what we have for production.

#### Reconnecting Sandbox to SFDC Staging
Sales Systems refreshes the [SFDC staging environment](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-systems/#sandbox-refreshes) periodically. When this occurs, there are several steps to take to reconnect it to the Marketo sandbox outlined on that page.


## Forms   
Nearly all the forms on our website (`about.gitlab.com`) are Marketo embedded forms. Marketing Operations is responsible for maintaining existing forms and creating any new forms. If you need a new form created, please open a [form creation issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=form_request).

Form documentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cV_hI2wAzLxYYDI-NQYF5-FDDPXPXH0VV5qRBUJAQQk). It contains all of our current forms, as well as standardized country and state picklists.

**Translated Forms Available**: Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, German, Portuguese, and Japanese. These are global forms, go to the Design Studio > Forms > Translated Forms. It is important to use these (and not clone) as they influence the [localization segmentation](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#segmentations) of `Language Preference`. 

If you require a new language or need a new form, please gather the [translations](/handbook/marketing/localization/#current-state) and then create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=form_request). Due to resource constraints, we are only creating new forms for [P0 countries](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/#priority-countries).

All forms should follow these guidelines:  
- Do not use lightboxes
- Field labels are always ALL CAPS
- Label width = 150 / Field width = 300
- Fields should be stacked in a vertical line
- `Country` field label should be `Country/Region`
- `State/Province` only visible when `Country` = `United States` or `Canada`; the visibility rule dynamically displays `Province` when `Canada` is selected or `State` when `United States` is selected 
- Generally `City` is only visible when `Country` = `Ukraine`
- Forms should all contain a checkbox to obtain consent to `opting in` to communications via email
- When `Country` = `Ukraine` there is an additional checkbox for the submitter to confirm they do not belong to the Crimean region of the Ukraine
- Country should not include [embargoed countries]/handbook/legal/trade-compliance/) 
- All forms should have hidden fields for Demandbase, gclid and google analytics tracking


If you are collecting home addresses for direct mail campaigns, you must include the following language on the landing page or form. Additionally, you must set up a deletion campaign in Marketo to remove their address information once you have sent the item. Please also ensure the vendor we are using to ship the items also deletes this from their records. `By giving us your home address, you are giving us permission to mail items to your home. We will not use this data for any other purposes.`


### Website Form Management

The forms on about.gitlab are embedded Marketo forms. Any changes to the fields, layout, labels and CSS occur within Marketo and can be pushed live without having to make any changes to the source file on GitLab. When needing to change or embed a whole new form, please open an issue using the `form_request` [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/form_request.md). 

If you are having trouble seeing a Marketo form, please reference [this page](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/website/#why-isnt-this-form-working).

Each Marketo form should push an event after successful submission to trigger events in Google Analytics. We use the following event labels to specify which events to fire.

1. `demo` for static demos on `/demo/` and `/demo-leader/`
1. `webcasts` for forms on any page in `/webcast/`
1. `trial` for the form on `/free-trial/`
1. `resources` for forms on any page in `/resources/`
1. `events` for forms on any page in `/events/`
1. `services` for form on `/services/`
1. `sales` for form on `/sales/`
1. `public-sector` for forms on `/solutions/public-sector/`
1. `mktoLead` legacy custom event label used on Newsletter subscription form submission events. Currently used for primary, security, and all-remote newsletter form submissions.

We add the following line above `return false` in the form embed code. Please update the event label from `demo` to reflect the appropriate form completion.

```
dataLayer.push(
{
  'event' : 'demo',
  'mktoFormId' : form.getId(),
  'eventCallback' : function()
  {}, 'eventTimeout' : 3000
});
```
### Program Asset Expiration

Starting in November 2022, teams within Marketo will transition to utilizing the [asset expiration feature](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/core-marketo-concepts/programs/working-with-programs/local-asset-expiration.html?lang=en#:~:text=Right%2Dclick%20on%20your%20desired,Choose%20an%20expiration%20date) added to the product in early 2022 as a way to declutter our expired landing pages and no longer relevant smart campaigns. Detailed instructions on this process can be found in our handbook on the [Campaigns and Programs](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/) page.

### Product data in Marketo

Data and engineering teams have developed integrations to bring data related to in-product customer and trial usage to Marketo. 

1. [Marketing Contact Datamart & Pump](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/marketing-operations/product-data/#marketing-datamart-pump-and-pql-information-email-marketing-data-mart): Fields start with `[CDB]`
2. [SaaS Trial & Handshakes](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/marketing-operations/product-data/#saas-trials--handraise) : Fields start with `[PQL]`
3. [Propensity to Buy Models](): Fields start with [PTPT] - TBC

### Campaign Limits

There is a set limit of 250,000 records that can be processed through a given smart or email campaign. If the smart campaign smart list is set to update or email over 250,000 records, it will not run and will be `aborted`. This is in place to prevent accidental mass updates and emails. If you need to run a campaign over that limit, reach out to MarOps.

#### Standardization of Country &/or State values

There are several workflows that clean the `Country` &/or `State` fields to ensure the value meets required Salesforce format. States should be spelled out, not using abbreviations (ex. CA should be California). If a `Country` &/or `State/Province` standardization does not match SFDC exactly, the lead will not sync. If a new standardization is needed, please open an issue in the [Marketing Operations project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=). If a country/state is updated in SFDC, the [customersDOT YML](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/3a7b78445d5cc1a5d53de7f003958004ec337ba5/data/countries.yml) file will also need to be updated to prevent sync issues.


All of the standardization smart campaigns are contained in:  

`Marketing Activities` -> `Operational - Do not edit` -> `Data Management` -> `01 Data Management` -> `04-Normalize Data`   

- These countries are the only ones that accept a state value: United States, Canada, Ireland, India, Brazil, Australia, China, Italy, Mexico
- All 50 US states and all Canadian Provinces have standardization campaigns to set them from their two letter abbreviation to their full spelling.
- The following countries have common variations updated to their accepted values: United States, Bolivia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Ireland, Macao, Myanmar, Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Venezuela, Vietnam.


## MQL and Lead Scoring
A Marketing Qualified Lead is a lead that has reached a threshold of `100` points, based on demographic/firmographic and/or behavioral information. The [MQL Scoring](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#scoring-model) is detailed below and is comprised of various actions and/or profile data that are weighted with positive or negative point values.

### Re-MQL
For additional information, visit the lead lifecycle page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/lead-lifecycle/#lead-lifecycle).

A Lead/Contact will be allowed to re-MQL if they are in a `Recycle` status and reach the [MQL threshold](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/) again. 

The number of times they `MQL` will be counted with the `MQL Counter` field.  The `Initial MQL DateTime` contains the very first time a prospect reached the [MQL threshold](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#lead-scoring-lead-lifecycle-and-mql-criteria).  `MQL Date` will be overwritten to be the most recent date that a lead has reached the MQL threshold.

When a lead is set to `Recycle`, their `Behavior Score` is reset to 0. Their `Person Score` is reset to the value of the `Demographic Score`. Additionally, a person who has reached `MQL` in the past, is given an additional score of `+20` when they are reset to `Recycle` and take an action to increase their behaviour score. If a lead was `Accepted` before it reached the MQL threshold, and is then set to `Recycle` within 30 days, the lead's `Behavior Score` will reset to the value it was while in `Inquiry` when they take an action, the `Demographic Score` will be re-run and their overall `Person Score` will be the sum of those two values.

When a lead `Re-MQLs` from `Recycle` to `MQL`, their `Recycle Reason` field is set to `Null`, but that `Recycle Reason` value is preserved in the field `Previous Recycle Value` on the lead or contact. That field is set by Marketo only. The `Recycle DateTime` only updates the first time. When a lead re-reaches an `MQL` status, they are not re-routed by LeanData for round-robin, they stay in their original owners name.

Follow the workflow mural to see the lead lifecycle. Notice you cannot go backwards in status to `Raw` or `Inquiry` from a later step.

### Scoring Model
The lead scoring model is a 100 point system in order to MQL. Positive and negative points are assigned to a record based on their demographic and/or firmographic information, and their behavior and/or engagement with GitLab marketing. Their `Person Score` is the sum of their `Behavior Score` and their `Demographic Score`. The `Person Score` must reach `100` in order to MQL, and their `Behavior Score` cannot be `0`.

For account scoring, visit the [DemandBase page](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/demandbase/#account-scoring).

There is a flow that runs everynight to reset leads that have gone negative back to `0`. 

Some leads are exluded from scoring if they:
* Have a `@gitlab.com` email address
* Are a competitor
* Status = `Disqualified` or `Bad Data`
* Company name of `student`, `personal`, `test` and similar 
* Actively worked by a partner (`Prospect Share Status` = `Sending to Partner`, `Accepted`, or `Pending`)

#### Auto-MQL
Based on certain criteria, a lead may auto-MQL. The scenarios are listed below:
- Self-Managed Trial + Business email domain
- SaaS Trial + Business email domain
- SaaS Trial + `Setup for Company/Use = TRUE`
- `Contact Us`, `Professional Services` or `Renewal` forms
- [Handraise PQL](/handbook/product/product-principles/#a-pql-can-be-further-broken-down-into-two-types-usage-and-hand-raise)
- In-app Health Check form
- Program status of `Follow Up Requested` 
- Drift interaction with meeting scheduled

#### Behavior Scoring

Behavior scoring is based on the actions that person has taken. The cadence of how often they can be scored is listed below. For campaign scoring, there must be a success in order to capture the score, those below are marked with a *. Refer to the [programs page and progression statuses](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs) to see what constitues a `success`.

## Lists and Segmentation

### Segmentations
Marketo segmentations are used similar to a smartlist, but they are permanent and can only be changed by marketing ops. They are used to create dynamic content (emails and landing pages) and are used for faster processing of lists. Segmentations are constantly running in the background in Marketo, so they never need to be refreshed for current numbers. We can only have 20 total segmentations in Marketo. Segmentation criteria waterfalls down based on the order of the segment lists that make up the segmentation. You can only be in one segment of a segmentation. 

The following segmentations that are approved and live.

### Account Based Marketing List   

ABM lists are built by request for the Field Marketing and Marketing Program team to target & send emails/invitations to accounts deemed to be high priority by Sales. You can find these lists in the DMA folder in the [Marketo Database](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52943077A1).
The **MktgOps** team is responsible for creating & maintaining these lists. 

If a new ABM list is needed, please open an issue using the [Target list issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new#request-confirm-target-list) and tag marketing ops.

### Geographic DMA List   

The Geographic DMA (direct marketing area) were built for the Field Marketing and Marketing Campaigns team to target & send emails/invitations related to Field &/or Corporate marketing events. The **MktgOps** team is responsible for creating & maintaining these lists.  You can find these lists in the `Database` of Marketo in the `Geographic DMA List` [Folder](https://app-ab13.marketo.com/#SL52900024A1). 

If a new DMA list is needed, please open an issue in the Marketing Operations project & utilize the [DMA_request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/issues/new?issuable_template=dma_request). 

#### Focused Email Lists
The Field Marketing and Marketing Campaigns teams use targeted email lists as a tool when pursuing specific regions, sectors or companies. Email list requests must be submitted using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new#request-confirm-target-list). From there, the campaign managers or marketing ops will build or review the list

#### SLA for Targeted Lists: 
* List request is required 7 days prior to email deployment - FMM / MPM
* Final Smart List is available 2 days prior to email deployment - MOps

#### List Exports
If you need a list export, please fill out an [export request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=export_request). 

A few users have permissions to export, they should follow proper data management procedures and avoid downloading PII for data analysis.



## Marketo Sales Insight
Marketo Sales Insight (MSI) is used to help give SFDC users visibility into the different actions Marketo is taking, and user actions through Marketo. Users can use this intelligence to have more meaningful conversations with prospects and also priority their leads based on score. You can read more on [Marketo's docs page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/marketo-sales-insight/msi-for-salesforce/features/insights-dashboard-feature-overview.html?lang=en).

The MSI tab can be placed on Leads, Contacts and Accounts page layouts. If you do not see it, or want access to it, create a [sales systems issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/new). 

You can also find MSI in a tab in your SFDC instance - click the `+` icon on your main SFDC banner and find `Marketo`. On that tab you will see an aggregate view of MSI.

There are a few main components to MSI: 

#### Insights
This tab shows a timeline of the most recent activity of a person. It shows `ALL` upcoming email campaigns and events (NOTE: This contains ALL upcoming emails/events, not just the ones sent to that prospect). In the timeline you can see web activity, email opens/clicks, and intersting moments. You can click into the lead timeline to see the specifics of each action. You will also see their overall score and a graph of the changes in the last 30 days. See screenshot below:

![Marketo Sales Insight](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/MSI.png)


#### Interesting Moments
Interesting moments are captured when a milestone is reached, usually when a person attends an event, program status changes or they fill out a form. SDRs use the `Last Interesting Moments` field in their lead views to quickly see what the last action the prospect took before becoming an Inquiry or MQL. If you would like an intersting moment added for a certain activity, reach out to Mops to have them build it for you.

#### Web Activity 
This tab shows all of the web activity of a cookied user in this view and includes the referring page. For lead/contacts it shows the activity for that particular person, for Accounts it shows activity for all contacts related to that account.

#### Score
Use this tab to see what the most recent score changes are. This is helpful to see all the different activities the person took to achieve the score they have. The campaign that caused the scoring can be cross referenced to the [scoring rubric](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#scoring-model) above.

#### Email
This tab shows all the emails sent to that specific person, the date and check boxes for if they opened or clicked.

#### Quick Actions and Watch List
You can add people to your watch list to keep a closer eye on them. You can access that watchlist by clicking the glasses next to `email`. Quick actions currently are not configured, but in the future may be used to add prospects to campaigns or to send an email via marketo.
