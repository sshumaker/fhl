# Lead Lifecycle

This page is a dedicated resource for all information on how we manage our lead lifecycle. We have two elements covering the lifecyle - The Lead / Contact Status in SFDC, and the Lifecycle Classifications Fields in SFDC. 

## Lead / Contact Status

We have nine Lead / Contact Statuses to represent where the lead currently sits within our sales cycle in Salesforce. Each `Status` that represents a situation where Sales Development is not actively engaging a lead or contact record has a corresponding queue that owns records until they meet the criteria to be assigned to Sales Development again for reengagement and qualification. This means there are currently "holding" queues for Lead / Contact Statuses with a queue indicated in the third column of the table below. (Note: The renaming or replacement of these queues with ones that match the updated Lead / Contact Statuses is ongoing and this handbook page will be updated with their new names as soon as the queues are created and actively being used in Salesforce.) 

| Status | Definition | Related Salesforce queue, if applicable |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Raw | Untouched prospect, default status | N/A, `Raw` leads should always be owned by the XDR who sourced them while they're being worked |
| Inquiry | Action was taken by the record to specifically give their contact information to GitLab | `Inquiry Queue` |
| MQL | Marketing Qualified through systematic means | N/A, `MQL`s are owned by the XDR responsible for engaging and qualifying them  |
| Accepted | Actively working to get in touch with the lead/contact | N/A, `Accepted` leads are owned by the XDR engaging and qualifying them |
| Qualifying | In 2-way conversation with lead/contact | N/A, `Qualifying` leads are owned by the XDR engaging and qualifying them |
| Qualified | SAO created & hand off to Sales team | N/A, `Qualified` leads represent leads that have been converted, most often to create an opportunity |
| Disqualified | Person has been disqualified from our sales cycle | `Unqualified Queue` (name change in progress) |
| Recycle | Record is not ready for our services or buying conversation now, possibly later | `Nurture Queue` (name change in progress) |
| Bad Data | Incorrect data - to potentially be researched to find correct data to contact by other means | `Bad Data Queue` |
| Ineligible | All leads/contacts that are ineligible to go through the sales process after an initial review | N/A at the moment, queue creation in progress |

In addition to our statuses, there are substatus that are required for XDRs to use. The substates are in use for the following Statuses: Disqualified, Ineligilble, Recycle & Bad Data:

## Lifecycle Classifications

We have 6 fields on the lead and contact that's purpose is to represent where the person is in their jouney with GitLab. 

| Field Name | Definition |
|-----|------|
| Unknown | This person has not matched with any accounts and is not a GitLab user |
| User | This person is a GitLab User |
| Prospect Hierarchy | This person has matched with an account that has first order available |
| Customer Hierarchy Account | This person has matched with an account that is a customer in their account hierarchy |
| Former Customer Account | This person has matched with an account that is a former customer |
| Partner Managed | This person is currently being managed by a partner |

The fields are formula fields and have three possible options - `True`, `False` or `-`, `-` means that we don't have enough information to say if the field is true or false so it will stay in `-` until the information becomes available. More information to come on how to leverage these fields.
