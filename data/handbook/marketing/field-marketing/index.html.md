# Field Marketing Mission

The mission of Field Marketing at GitLab is to strategically support the Large, Mid-Market & Public Sector go-to-market teams at **a regional level** through in-person and virtual interactions (quality vs. quantity) as well as serving as the voice of the regional go-to-market teams to the wider marketing team, and being the voice of marketing into the go-to-market teams we support, in order to create, accelerate, and expand the sales pipeline with our direct sellers and partner ecosystem. In alignment with the marketing mission of being New First Order focused, Field Marketing also supports the expand motion with customers.

# Field Marketing Vision

We want to be the most innovative and pipeline centric team within the marketing organization that uses data to make informed decisions while also continuing to invest in ourselves to promote career growth and opportunities.

# Field Marketing Goals

- Sales Acceleration
    - Engaging with existing customers
    - New growth opportunities
- Demand
    - Unique inquiries
    - Influence of [sales accepted opportunties](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#common-sales-development-org-terms-and-definitions)
    - Influence of sales pipeline
    - Both direct and channel driven
- Market Intelligence
    - Test out new messaging or positioning

# Countries of Focus
Our countries of focus can be [found here](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/globalization/#globalization) in our internal handbook.

# Cities of Focus

## Tier 1 Cities
A Field Marketer should have no more than 5 cities - cities with the largest LAM - that you want to build a ground swell in and be physically present at least 2/quarter.

## Tier 2 Cities

A Field Marketer should have no more than 3 Tier 2 cities - cities you want to be physically present in at least 1/quarter.

FMMs should work with Large & MM sales teams to determine these cities.

# Types of Programs Field Marketing Runs

## GitLab Owned Field Events

### [GitLab Connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwpNKoI4uU)

GitLab Connect is a full or half day event with both customers and prospects in attendance sharing stories & lessons learned about GitLab. SAL's will be responsible for asking customers to speak and Marketing, through a combination of SDR outreach, database and ad geotargeting will drive attendance to the event. If you would like to propose a GitLab Connect in your city, please follow [these instructions](/handbook/marketing/events/#suggesting-an-event) for requesting an event. Interested in seeing a GitLab Connect in action? [Check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwpNKoI4uU)

### Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events

For information regarding process, epic codes, templates and more, please visit our [**Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/) page.

## 3rd Party Events

We will sponsor regional 3rd party events in an effort to build the GitLab brand and also to gather leads. Different types of 3rd party events include, but are not limited to:

- DevOps Days
- Agile Events
- City run technology meetings
- Customer/prospect run DevOps events on invite
- Executive relationship building events via companies like Apex Assembly & Argyle Executive Forum

#### Executive Roundtables

Executive Roundtables can be run virtual or in-person and differ from webcasts/events mainly due to the size of the audience and the interactivity level. A roundtable is run as an open discussion between the host (usually 3rd party vendor), GitLab presenter and the audience. The host would open with an introduction of themselves and the topic for the session, then introduce the GitLab presenter and have them give an overview of GitLab followed by the host asking questions directly to specific people in the audience for them to openly answer and discuss. The advantage of a roundtable is that you can document the meeting more closely and understand more about an organization’s pains and problems.

Below are best practices when running a roundtable:

- Content creation - FMM to work with Sales Managers to decide on most relevant or hot topics in the region
- Speaker request - Put through a Product and Solution Marketing Support Request and fill out the template
- [Example of scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iy7AreiMM7seZM_EidixqdUw-OG__-cnl6pihqH72eY/edit#heading=h.btpndxf36cvl) for host and GitLab presenter
- [Example of meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2m3Izn66u9xuWGDHmR5_YJcWdUhKupfVlWVPjWGLL0/edit) to document conversations during the session
- Ensure questions are prepared between host and GitLab presenter beforehand to lead the conversations within the session
- Assign notes of each delegate to list leads for upload onto SFDC
- Pre-analysis of delegates - check to see if their organization is currently a user of GitLab, whether they’re CE or EE customers. This could be a great way to start or dig into deeper conversations with the delegate.

### How to operationally set up an in-person event

Field Marketing works closely with our Marketing Program Managers to functionally set up and execute our in person events. For complete details on our shared process, including the epic/issue creation process, please review our [event execution page](/handbook/marketing/events/#event-execution).

## Other Tactics

Being the marketing experts for the region, GitLab Field Marketers are also responsible for using other tactics to help generate leads to build pipeline. We have options such as survey tools, both of current employees and past employees based on the 3rd party vendor we use, webcasts, direct mailings, and also various digital tactics.

### ReachDesk
Go to the [Reachdesk page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/reachdesk) for instructions on campaign set up. (WIP)

### Linkedin events Feature - FMM team access

#### About
The Field marketing team can use the GitLab Brand LinkedIn channel to create events. The LinkedIn Events feature provides members with an easy way to create and join professional Events that interest them, such as meetups, online workshops, seminars, and more.

#### Successful usage
##### [Field Marketing Linkedin admin for events quick training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxVxdjeRkps)
- The Field Marekting LinkedIn events admin can create, edit and maintain the events listings on the GitLab LinkedIn page. Please message the field marketing team in the #fieldmarketing Slack channel to request the admin to create an event.

###### Field Marketing admins who will respond to your request:
* Kira Aubrey - AMER
* Helena Dixon - EMEA
- Information to be included on event pages: Title of event, date, time, region,registration link and About or description.
- Field marketing are not authorized to write posts, edit the page or its contents, or to respond to users via the corporate LinkedIn account.
- LinkedIn events should only be used for events and not for campaigns.

Find out more on the social media page[here](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/#field-marketing-team-access-to-linkedin-events-feature)

### Best Practices
- The LinkedIn Event CTA button ATTEND is not synced to the registration link on our marketo registration page. The admin should include additional instructions in the About section of the LinkedIn event, for example: Please use the registration link to enter your details to register for this event.
- Add the LinkedIn events links into the SDR Request issue. A suggestion would be for the SDR team to check the LinkedIn events attendee list one week before each event to see who has clicked "ATTEND" on LinkedIn and compare the list with our registration list in SFDC. Then reach out to those who didn't register with a personalised LinkedIn inmail to invite them to register.

## Digital Tactics

- To run plays where we are targeting a specific geography or where we would like to propose content syndication, we work through our Digital Marketing Programs team. Please create an issue utilizing DMPs [Paid Digital Request Issue Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/digital-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=paid-digital-request) if you'd like them to do work for you.
- To run plays where we are targeting a specific list of accounts, we utilize [Demandbase](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/demandbase/).

### Tracking success of digital tactics
Please ensure you are using our UTM tracker (look up `Google Analytics Campaign Tagging Tool - UTM generator for tracking` in the Gdrive to find doc). In order to identify which campaigns are from the Field Marketing team, you must add the letters fmm at the end of your campaign name in column E. All lowercase with no spaces or special characters. This allows us to pull ROI reporting, so please don't leave these letters out or else you will lose reporting from a dashboard standpoint.

## Individual Tactics

Remember, an account-centric micro-campaign consists of at least 2 different account-centric tactics. If you are planning an individual tactic, follow the [plan to WIP process](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#process-for-issues-moving-from-plan-to-wip). Refer to the information provided in [Steps for the Creation and Organization of Micro-Campaign Epics & Issues](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#steps-for-the-creation-and-organization-of-micro-campaign-epics--issues), for _how_ to create the issues & epics if needed.

### Examples of Individual Tactics

#### Content Syndication

1. FMM opens a [Content Syndication Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Content_Syndication_Template)
1. FMM and FMC to follow Plan to WIP process [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#process-for-issues-moving-from-plan-to-wip)

#### Self-Service Virtual Event With or Without Promotion

1. FMM opens a [Self-Service Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Self_Service_Event)
1. FMM and FMC to follow Plan to WIP process [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#process-for-issues-moving-from-plan-to-wip)

# Confidentiality in GitLab Issues and Epics

When working in GitLab issues and epics, please remember that due to GitLab's value of [Transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), many of our issues and epics are, by default, public. Best practice is to avoid including any PII or login details in issues and epics directly. If posting details of this nature is a necessity, please remember to always make your [issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html#make-an-issue-confidential) or [epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#make-an-epic-confidential) `Confidential` when doing so. Please also be diligent in your issues and epics regarding comments made by other team members as well. If you notice another team member has posted details that should not remain public, immediately make the [issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html#make-an-issue-confidential) or [epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#make-an-epic-confidential) `Confidential`. Other options to allow our issues to remain public, are including PII in a spreadsheet or document posted in the issue or epic that are only accesible by certain people. If logins need to be shared, please utilize the Marketing Vault in [1pass](/handbook/security/#security-process-and-procedures-for-team-members).

For more information regarding confidentiality levels and compliancy, please visit [this handbook page](/handbook/communication/confidentiality-levels/).

# Suggested workflow to ensure your campaigns are accurate

After Field Marketing has run a campaign, the Field Marketing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the campaign has operationally fully run to include the following:

- The campaign DRI reviews and cleans up list following the guidelines for [list imports](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/)
- SDRs should not be asked to follow up leads before they are added to Salesforce
- If a follow-up email was to go out to all attendees and no-shows, the FMM is responsible for ensuring that emails were sent.
- Did the campaign respondents receive the correct amount of MQL points they should have received for the activity the took?
    - Person score is available to be viewed in our `Custom Links` section of each SFDC campaign. This allows you to view the MQL score of the campaign members, whether they be a lead or contact, all within one view.
- Did a lead/contact hit our MQL threshold and have the SDRs followed up with this record and moved them beyond the [MQL stage](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/)?
- Update all the relevant tabs in the field marketing campaign event planning sheet.

# ROI tracking for Field Marketing

For a complete picture of GitLab Marketing Metrics, please refer to our [Marketing Metrics page](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/marketing-metrics/).

This section will go into specifics on the workflow for a Field Marketer to check their results.

At the highest level, Field Marketing is responsible for helping to progress MQLs with the rest of the Integrated Marketing team. Those MQLs will ultimately create [Sales Accepted Opportunities](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-sdr-alignment/#criteria-for-sales-accepted-opportunity) by the Sales Development team.  We also track campaign contribution to the sales pipeline as well as velocity of the opportunities that interact with our campaigns.

## The Field Marketing Dashboard
Our FMM Dashboard lives in the SAFE Intermediate space within the platform and provides an overview on the performance of the Field Marketing programs.

### Field Marketing ROI to GitLab Channel
GitLab Field Marketing receives `credit`for the Partner Sourced Opportunity if the opportunity has a Bizible touchpoint from the FMM campaign.

* [Sisense Marketing influenced opportiunity report](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-intermediate-dashboard/983640/WIP:-Partner-Sourced)
* [Sisense Leads passed to the parnter report](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-intermediate-dashboard/992265/WIP:-Partner-Lead-Status)

#### Back up SFDC leads passed to partner report
* [Leads](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004enu7)
* [Contacts](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004enuC)

Please clone and modify the reports based on the campaign name you are wanting to dig into. Reminder that SFDC treats leads and contacts separetely, so you'll need both a leads and a contacts report to see full picture.

#### Back up SFDC detailed reports
We have 3 reports we use that shows different types of contribution to the GitLab channel program.

* [FMM_DP_Channel_AllCampaigns](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004opQ0) - Field Marketing Deal Path = Channel. Field Marketing impact on all deal path = Channel. Includes MORE than just channel generated opps & regardless if a specific channel partner was directly involved with campaign.
* [FMM_SQS_Channel_Generated](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004opqh) - Field Marketing Sales Qualified Source = Channel. FMM impact on Deal path = channel AND channel generated opps and regardless if a specific channel partner was directly involved with campaign.
* [FMM CAMPAIGNS specific impact DP channel](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004opqr) - Field Marketing Campaigns impact to Deal Path = Channel.  Opp Deal path = Channel - Impact from FMM campaigns runs specifically with channel.

The above reports are Bizible attribution reports at the person level, you will need to understand how many unique opportunies are in your report. In order to do this, you will download the report from SFDC, and then upload into google sheets, then use the unique count formula (=countA(unique(B:B)),where counta = the bizible touchpoint ID & unique B = the name of the opportunity.

[Example SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004opfA) and an [example google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vKuafod5__ORqv0bCGiasMr1ANPlzPUY_95RN6Pwr0/edit#gid=48544605&range=P1) with the forumla.

* [Records passed to partners](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008RSHg) - As part of our [campaigns we run jointly with channel partners](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/partner-campaigns/#joint-gitlab-and-partner-events), we would like to understand the status of records we've passed to partners, this report give us that insight.

### Contribution to sales pipeline

This can be calculated by heading to the [Marketing Linear Attribution Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-intermediate-dashboard/965070/WIP:-TD-Attribution). NOTE: Ensure you’ve got your filters properly dialed in.
* Default to setting the opportunity created date to the current fiscal year - to pull the data you'd like to report out on
* It takes about 15 days for MQLs<>SAO, therefore pull the campaigns report

### How to track the ROI of an in person event

- SAOs accepted - Reference the SAO accepted SFDC report.
- Contribution to pipeline - Reference the Linear Attribution dashboard.

If you spent money on digital ads to drive registration, then you’ll also want to check on the ROI of your spend. Head down to the How to track the ROI of your Digital Tactics section, which is relevant for all digital spend.

### How to track the ROI of your Digital Tactics

#### 3rd Party digital agency

In order to track engagement for any work we do with on the digital side of the house, a campaign UTM code will be created by the DMP team. The DMP team uses this UTM code to create a SFDC UTM Report. Please note a SFDC UTM Report is not the same as a SFDC Campaign (which pulls in registrations for events, webinars and content syndication leads). It is a dedicated report for our paid digital efforts only. For more information on UTM's at GitLab [can be found here](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/digital-strategy-management/#utm-tracking).

You will follow this process when you are working with our 3rd party digital agency to serve your target audience ads/LinkedIn InMails.

At the highest level, it's interesting to see the spend, clicks, impressions, CPC (cost per click), inquiries, and CPI (cost per inquiry). This is done by going to the Field Marketing Specific digital spend Dashboard via our digital team, linked in the `Useful Links` section and searching for your campaign using the campaigns UTM code. Here is the report as well, because we know sometimes you just want the link in the exact place you are looking for it in ;) . [WW SFDC Field Marketing Digital Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aA0V)

Inquiries (people who end up registering for your event or engaging with your ad) are the most important to look into and really the status of them attending your event or interacting with your campaign, eventually leading to an SAO and then pipeline!

If you were driving people to register for something, then hop over to your SFDC campaign. Then go down to the `Custom Links` section and click on the `View All Campaign Members` report.

You’ll then want to sort by `Ad Campaign Name (FT)`, which answers the question “What was the 1st touch ad this record interacted with?” and also the `Ad Campaign Name (LC)`, which answers the question “What ad created this lead?”.

If you did not have a specific SFDC Campaign you were driving to, and you wanted to see the success of your campaign, then you would still refer to the [WW SFDC Field Marketing Digital Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aA0V), add in your campaigns UTM there, using the filter `Ad Campaign Name` [contains] and add your UTM.

Please note that whilst you can track leads via SFDC campaigns or UTM reports, pipeline generated should be viewed on [Sisense](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-intermediate-dashboard/965070/WIP:-TD-Attribution) only, as SFDCs last touch model is different from our multi touch attribution model.

#### How to trouble shoot your ROI questions
If you have a quick 1 off question on reporting, then please feel free to ask the question in the #fieldmarketing slack channel.

If you have several questions or a more robust analysis of data you'd like help with, please open a [FMM leadership request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leadership_request) and assign it to your manager. Your manager will review and will pull in the Director or other folks as needed.

#### Field Marketers within SFDC
To help with reporting within SFDC, each Field Marketing Manager is assigned the accounts based on SAL/AE assignment. Field Marketing has decided to align with the SAL/AE vs. 100% geo focused in an effort to foster collaboration.  The assignments are done through [Lean Data](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/leandata/), which is our lead routing tool.

Routing for geo reps is done through zip codes worldwide. Named accounts and the US Public Sector are manually handled differently. Sales Ops will run monthly audits to update PubSec and Named accounts. Field Marketing Management works with Sales Ops to keep this information up to date.

Should you come across an account you believe should be owned (or perhaps NOT owned by you) please follow these steps:
1. Within the account in SFDC, please chatter @sales-support and provide reason why this account should be updated
1. If more than 10 accounts need updated or if a FMM changes regions, then please open a [sales ops issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=General%20Request) requesting the update be made.

Complete details on how GitLab Sales handles rules of Account Engagement can be [found here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/).

#### PathFactory

Via our Marketing Operations team, Field Marketers can request Author Role access to PathFactory to upload and curate assets into tracks that are then disseminated for use in Marketo, about.gitlab.com, and other campaign-related channels. Field Marketing currently has Reporter level access. To view the difference in user roles, head over to the [PathFactory page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/#access).

### The Benefits of having Author Role Access
1. Efficiency gains: It takes more time to create a request issue for the Campaigns Team and wait for the request to be processed than it takes to upload an asset or create the track yourself.
1. Ownership: Having author role access to PathFactory will allow Field Marketing to have control on asset uploads and content tracks to ultimately personalise the PathFactory experience according to region, country and target accounts.

# Process for Issues Moving from Plan to WIP

The following is the process for when a Field Marketing issue moves from `mktg-status::plan` to `mktg-status::wip`.

## SLA

FMMs are to provide a 5 business day lead time for all plan to WIP requests in order to give FMCs time to complete the request. Also keep in mind that we have a 5 business day [SLA with Verticurl](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/agency-verticurl/#sla-with-verticurl), so please plan ahead accordingly.

## Items required by FMM to request moving an issue from Plan to WIP

- Contract is fully executed (if applicable) - For contract approval, FMM is to obtain the agreement from the vendor, review and make any changes needed with the vendor, then submit a [Contract Request](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-contract-requests) to the FMC for processing through Zip.
- Event Details and FMC Checklist sections in the main issue are updated and complete
- Allocadia sub-category and line item detail panels are updated and complete

## Moving from Plan to WIP

- FMM pings the FMC in the main Field Marketing issue and requests the FMC move the issue to WIP (FMM keeps issue label `mktg-status::plan`)
- FMC reviews the Allocadia sub-category and line item panel details for the tactic and makes any changes necessary
- FMC requests the Allocadia line item ID for the tactic be added to Netsuite in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBqvCvmou4afnb0p8lBXVvFmsl-j0IehS7GdfJybGzg/edit#gid=518252060) (if not already completed during the contract process)
- FMC adds the Allocadia line item ID and the campaign name to the event details section of the issue, where indicated, as well as checks off the box that the Allocadia ID has been created in Netsuite
- FMC creates the epic and sub-issues utilizing [this list of epics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status)
- FMC creates the [Marketo program and SFDC campaign](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#campaign-type--progression-status) utilizing the [Program Tracking](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/program-tracking.md) sub-issue previously created
   - FMC pings the FMM in the Program Tracking issue that the Marketo program and SFDC campaign have been created and closes issue
- FMC adds the event to the appropriate events calendar. All events should be added to the appropriate calendar from the list below.
   - [In-Person Events and Sponsorship](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV9laWN2b3VkcHBjdTQ3bG5xdTFwOTlvNjU2Z0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

# Process to Close Marketo Landing Pages and Landing Page Forms

## Marketo Asset Expiration

As of Nov 2022, when applicable, please follow the instructions found on the [campaigns and programs](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#step-4b-setting-landing-page--smart-campaign-expiration-asset-expiration) handbook page to set expirations on program assets during program set up.

## Options for Closing LPs and LP Forms

There are two options for closing Marketo landing pages:

1. Closing the LP registration form (which removes the registration form from the LP so registrations can no longer be accepted) and updating the LP to explain why the registration form is no longer available (either the event has reached capacity or the event has occurred).
2. Closing the entire LP. If someone clicks on the LP link, it will take them to our about.gitlab.com page instead of a registration LP. This option is now done automatically during the [Marketo Asset Expiration process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#step-4b-setting-landing-page--smart-campaign-expiration-asset-expiration). Asset expiration occurs 4 weeks after the event date, so it is important to close the registration form and update the LP verbiage once an event reaches capacity or has occurred so the LP does not remain open and active during this time.

The FMC will track all open Marketo LPs and will be responsible for requesting the LP form be closed once the event occurs or if an event reaches capacity. If Verticurl is unavailable and the request is urgent, the FMC can follow the below steps as well. If the campaign type is not listed below and the request is urgent, please reach out to Marketing Ops to help close the registration form.

To close the LP registration form, the FMC will re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Verticurl follow one of the below processes (depending on campaign type, as Marketo program templates vary across different tactics). In the LP issue, the FMC will request Verticurl remove the registration form and will provide Verticurl specific verbiage for the top of the LP page. Please see standard verbiage options below. If the event is a workshop that was listed on the demo/workshop page, the FMC will also request Verticurl remove the listing. The FMC will update the due date of the issue and move the triage label back to `FMM-Verticurl::WIP`.

## If an event has reached capacity
- The FMC will follow the above instructions to close the LP regisrtation form and update the verbiage to specify the event has reached capacity.
- If there are remaining invite issues open once registration is closed, the FMC will note this in the issue(s) and close them. If an invite is already scheduled to be sent, the FMC will ask Verticurl to unschedule the send before closing the issue. The FMC will update the due date of the issue and move the triage label back to `FMM-Verticurl::WIP`.
- The FMC will also re-open the sales nominated issue and request Verticurl shut down the sales-nominated daily sends. The FMC will update the due date of the issue and move the triage label back to `FMM-Verticurl::WIP`.
- If an intelligent nurture email request was opened, the FMC will ping `@dambrold` in the issue to remove the email from the nurture streams.
- There is no need to remove the event listing from the [Events Page](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents) if an event has reached capacity. Having a sold out event listed could create more excitement over the event and encourage future attendees to register for events sooner.

## Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP after the event has occurred
*The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Verticurl when closing a Marketo LP form after an event has occurred.*

Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. This event has concluded and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our [events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) for more information on upcoming events and dates.

## Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP if an event is at capacity
*The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Verticurl when closing a Marketo LP form if an event is at capacity.*

Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. The event has reached capacity and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our [events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) for more information on upcoming events and dates.

## Closing a Marketo LP Form
These instructions explain how to close a Marketo LP form and how to update the LPs verbiage at the top of the page. The page and the information on it will still be visible to visitors, but there will no longer be a form to fill out for registration.

### Closing a Self-Service Marketo LP Form

See instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#closing-registration-1).

### Closing a Webcast Marketo LP Form

See instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#closing-a-webcast-landing-page).

### Closing a Workshop Marketo LP Form

See instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/field-marketing-owned-virtual-events/#instructions-for-closing-registration-for-a-workshop).

## Adding and Removing Workshop Postings on the Regional Workshop Demo Pages

We market our workshops on both the [GitLab events page](https://about.gitlab.com/events/) and via the below regional workshop/demo pages. The GitLab events page listings require an MR to add new events (see instructions [here](/handbook/marketing/events/#how-to-add-events-to-aboutgitlabcomevents)) and events will automatically drop off the page once the event date passes. But the regional workshop/demo pages require manual adjustment. When a workshop LP is created by Verticurl, they will add to the appropriate regional workshop/demo page once the LP is approved. When a workshop is completed and the FMC requests that Verticurl closes the LP, Verticurl will also remove the listing from the regional workshop/demo page. These Verticurl to do items are listed in the [Marketo LP issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/request_mkto_landing_page.md).

- [AMER Workshop/Demo Page](https://page.gitlab.com/events-amer-enterprise.html)
- [EMEA Workshop/Demo Page](https://page.gitlab.com/events-pd-emea.html)
- [APAC Workshop/Demo Page](https://page.gitlab.com/events-pd-technical-apac.html)

### Regional Workshop Demo Pages - Instructions for Verticurl

Verticurl will follow the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vu3NOuiFwBE) and in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/1788) to add and remove postings on the regional workshop demo pages. Verticurl is only responsible for adding/removing events for the AMER and EMEA pages. The Campaigns Team will manage the APAC pages.

- [AMER Workshop/Demo Page](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/LP7547B2) - Verticurl
- [EMEA Workshop/Demo Page](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/LP7582A1LA1) - Verticurl
- [APAC Workshop/Demo Page - General](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/LP7646A1LA1) - Campaigns Team
- [APAC Workshop/Demo Page - Paid Promotion](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/LP7646A1LA1) - Campaigns Team

For more information regarding the regional workshop/demo pages, please visit [this handbook page](/handbook/marketing/virtual-events/webcasts/#technical-demo-landing-pages).

## Closing a Marketo LP
These instructions are standard across all campaign types and will close down the entire LP and re-routes visitors to our about.gitlab.com page. If you have set up [asset expiration](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#step-4b-setting-landing-page--smart-campaign-expiration-asset-expiration) previously, this step will occur automatically.

- Sign into Marketo
- Click into the Marketo program for the landing page you wish to close
- Click into `Assets`
- Click `Registration Landing Page`
- At the top of the page click `Landing Page Actions`
- In the drop down list click `Unapprove`
- Click the orange `Unapprove` button in the pop up box
- Go to your landing page URL and make sure the landing page is no longer active (the site that should pop up is `about.gitlab.com`)
- Go to the `01a or 01b Registration Flow and deactivate the smart campaign

## Adding a Registrant after Marketo LP Reg Form is Closed
If you have closed a Marketo LP registration form because your event has reached capacity but need to add in an important registrant after the fact, please follow the below instructions.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Field Marketing does not have access for the below actions. Please ping Marketing Operations in the `#mktgops` Slack channel to add registrants when needed.

Important context: The landing page and form themselves have no bearing on whether or not someone is synced. The sync relies solely on `Program Members` and their statuses. Thus, a person can fill out a form, but if their program member status is never updated to `Registered`, they will never sync over into the webcast in Zoom. Likewise, we can update someone's status to `Registered` without any form every being filled out, and they will still sucessfully sync to Zoom.

1. Navigate to the `Database` tab in Marketo
1. In the quick find box, type in the person's email and click the magnifying glass to search (If they do not exist, click `NEW` in the upper ribbon and add a `new person`. It will take up to 10 minutes for them to then show in the lead database)
1. It will take you to a screen with everyone matching your query. Once you find the correct person, click them to highlight.
1. Once highlighted, you can right click or select `Person Actions` from the upper ribbon
1. Hover over `Programs` and click on `Change Program Status...`
1. Search for the program you want to add them to (it should be the main program, not an invite send, etc) and select the status of `Registered`
     - Check how many people this will affect. It should just be 1 (or the number you highlighted)
1. Click `RUN NOW` to execute the action
1. A status box will appear on the top right and tell you when the action finishes processing
     - Once added as `Registered` scoring will trigger for the registrant
     - Once the registrant is synced to zoom (within 30 min or so), the registrant will receive a confirmation email automatically from Zoom.

You can use these steps to add anyone to a Marketo program.

## Registration Problems on a GitLab Landing Page

If a registrant is having issues registering for an event on a GitLab landing page, please have them first try the below fixes. If these still do not work, open a [bug issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/bug_request.md?_gl=1%2a1652726%2a_ga%2aMTg4MDU0MzY5Ni4xNjAxMTI2MTEw%2a_ga_ENFH3X7M5Y%2aMTY2NzU3MzczMi4xNTAuMS4xNjY3NTc3MDQyLjAuMC4w) with Marketing Ops to help determine if there is a problem with the landing page.
- Ask what browser they are utilizing and if there are any plugins potentially blocking the registration page.
- If they have not already, have them try registering utilizing Chrome.
- Have them try registering using Incognito Mode.

# Owned Tactics that Involve Collecting Addresses
There are times that Field Marketing will run campaigns that involve building a landing page in Marketo in order to collect addresses for shipping swag. Examples of these instances are a 5k run, GitLab-hosted tasting event, direct mail campaigns, etc. When collecting addresses, please follow the below instructions for ensuring PII compliancy.

## Landing Page Verbiage
When collecting addresses on our Marketo landing pages, make sure to always include the following verbiage on the page - `By giving us your address, you are giving us permission to mail items to your home or office. We will not use this data for any other purposes.`

## Pulling Addresses for Swag Sends
Please note that due to PII compliancy, addresses collected in Marketo landing pages are not synced to SFDC. As a result, Marketing Ops support is required to pull the address list from Marketo (Field Marketing does not have this level of access in Marketo).

## Removing PII from Marketo
Once the report is downloaded (or the event/tactic has ended and all swag has been sent), Marketing Ops will then also delete the PII information directly in Marketo. To request this support, please review [this page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#list-exports) and open an [export request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=export_request) to specify when a list pull and PII deletion is needed. Also remember to delete PII from any order spreadsheets once swag has shipped.

### Details Regarding Swag and Event Asset Ordering

- You are required to provide an Allocadia ID and event name for all Boundless orders. All charges related to swag and shipping will be associated to your specific campaign. Please see [this page](/handbook/marketing/#how-marketing-tracks-campaign-expenses) for additional Allocadia ID information.
- When orders are placed through the Boundless portal, A51 Logistics' UPS account will be utilized for shipping charges. These charges will process through our monthly invoice and charges will be associated to the Allocadia ID provided when ordering.
- Item quantities are listed in the portal. Please select from the current items in stock for your event. If you need a larger quantity of an item over what is available, or you intend to utilize the remaining stock for an item, please reach out to `@krogel` for reordering.
- If you would like to source a new swag item, please reach out to `@krogel` directly. All new swag items must be approved by the Brand team for brand consistency.
- Please be aware that ordering newly designed swag or placing reorders for existing items requires adequate lead time. Timeframes vary greatly based on the items selected, design approval, and availability. General Lead Times: 6 weeks to produce a new item and 2-3 weeks to reorder current designs

### AMER Field Marketing Event Assets

It is recommended that each Field Marketer keep a separate GitLab tablecloth, popup banner and table runner with them at home for easy access and to be utilized for events. Ordering instructions are provided during onboarding, but if replacement items are needed, please contact `@krogel`. Additional event assets utilized for shows (including backwalls, tablecloths, popup banners, DevOps Days kits, etc.) are stocked at the Boundless warehouse and can be shipped via the [Boundless Portal](https://gitlabstore.mybrightsites.com).

### Returning AMER Field Marketing Event Assets and Swag

It is the FMM’s responsibility to not only ship assets to events, but to also ensure the onsite event DRI ships the items back within **3 days** of the end of the event. Every order placed through the Boundless portal will include a clearly marked return label inside of each box. The FMM is to make sure the onsite event DRI is aware of the location of the return shipping labels and of their responsibility to ship the items back.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Trash should not be put into the return shipping boxes. All event assets are to be packed up cleanly and securely in their original boxes. All tool kit items should be returned to the tool kits for future event use. Do not send small numbers of swag back to the warehouse if the items were bundled. Only send full bundles back to the warehouse for restock. Example: If pens come in bundles of ten, please do not send back 2 pens as these cannot be rebundled. Feel free to keep small quantities of extra swag to give out to customers, if appropriate. Also, only open swag bundles as they are needed so items can be returned if not used. If you have any questions, please contact `@krogel`.

If you are interested in ordering new swag, please open a [Swag Request Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Swag_Request_Template) and assign `@krogel`. If you believe the swag item is something the entire AMER team would be interested in utilizing, you can add an item to our weekly team agenda or send a message in the `#amerfmteamctf` Slack channel to check and see if any other FMMs would be interested in also ordering the item and splitting the cost. If splitting the cost between regions, please remember to utilize the `ALL AMER` plan in Allocadia for [budgeting](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#the-field-marketing-budget) and to indicate which regions are sharing the cost in the Swag Request Issue.

# Sourcing New Field Marketing Vendors

Field marketers are always looking for new ways to support the sales teams within their regions and to provide unique, alternative ways to draw potential prospects closer to our company and show value to our current customers in order to expand within those accounts. Field marketers have a vast tool kit of marketing initiatives for precisely that. However, sometimes a gap is identified and field marketers will look to external third party vendors to help fill that gap when it comes to achieving their goals to their marketing metrics.

When souring and selecting a new third-party vendor, there are a few things that should be considered:

1. What are you trying to achieve? What is the gap you have identified? Is it filling the top of the funnel? Building relationships within a specific target audience (i.e. C-Level)? Maybe your goal is delivering on more qualified leads? Be clear on your end goal(s) from the beginning.
1. Can this vendor achieve your goal? Have the vendor show you proven use cases and references on your specific goals.
1. Have you sourced more than 1 vendor? A good point of reference is to research at least 2 or 3.
1. Is this vendor willing to proceed with a pilot program with you? Even with the best intentions, not all 3rd party vendors will fulfill your needs as originally discussed. A pilot program will allow you to try out the vendor and/or their product without requiring a full investment up front.
1. Identify all of the pieces of the contract. Ensure that you and the 3rd party vendor are aligned on the following:
    - Cost
    - Timeline of project
    - Timeline of onboarding
    - What is required when it comes to integration - Full Access, No Access or Partial Access
    - What are your deliverables?
    - What are their deliverables?
    - Identify who needs to be trained. What does that training involve?
    - Who will be the DRI for the project (always have 1 person who will support you during your contract process)?
    - What is the cost of renewal, or, if you are running a pilot, what is the cost of a full term contract?
    - If you're running a pilot, what are the goals you have in place to determine if you should invest beyond the pilot phase?

Once you feel confident that you have chosen the right 3rd party vendor, now is the time to begin the following review process.

# Software Vendor/Product Approval Process

1. FMM and FMC to review the [Procurement Handbook Page](/handbook/finance/procurement/#when-should-i-contact-procurement) so you are familiar with the procurement process and lead times. Please be aware of the [SLAs](/handbook/finance/procurement/#-how-long-does-it-take-to-approve-my-coupa-purchase-request) for processing all reviews, approvals and contract negotiations. Note that if the overall cost of the product is over $100k, 2-3 comparison bids are required.
1. FMM to open a Field Marketing issue and detail out the justification for the potential new vendor/product. Include any presentations, slides and demos that have been provided to help explain the product. Tag your regional manager in the issue to review and discuss. Approval must be received to move forward. Make sure to attach all of the following issues to your main Field Marketing Issue for easy access.
1. FMM to open a [Contract Request](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-contract-requests) issue and assign to the regional FMC.
    - SLA for FMC to complete the Contract Request issue is 3 business days from the date all needed info is filled out by the FMM in the Contract Request issue. FMM to leave a note if turnaround is urgent (FMCs have been averaging 1-2 business days currently).
1. FMC to process an NDA with the vendor, specified in the procurement handbook [here](/handbook/legal/procurement-guide-collaborating-with-gitlab-legal/#nda-process). Remember to attach your executed NDA when opening your Zip requisition in the steps below.
1. If you're requesting a new tool, FMM to open a [Marketing Ops Eval](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#requesting-a-new-tool) issue. Marketing Ops will help evaluate the product and will assist in the procurement process. They will also help you determine if an integration is required with any products in our current tech stack and if so, which team will be the DRI for the integration.
1. FMC to follow [these instructions](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide) for opening a Zip requisition. Please note that you can submit the Zip requisition even before a contract has been provided. This template details the following approvals:
    - NDA requirement
    - Privacy review (if applicable)
    - Security review
    - Tech stack request (for new software purchases)
1. If you're requesting a new tool, and if the new product requires integration with any of our existing products (SFDC, Marketo, Outreach, etc.) FMC to open an integration request issue with the appropriate team (see step above where the Marketing Ops team will help determine). Integration will not begin until all approvals are final and the contract has been fully executed, but opening the integration issue early will give the appropriate team advance notice for planning.

# AMER Field Marketing Event Venue Tracking

The below epic is for tracking venues we would like to utilize for future events, or as a way to evaluate event venues we have already worked with to note the pros and cons of various event space across different regions.

- [AMER Field Marketing Event Venues Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/625)

# Field Marketing Contract Requests

In Field Marketing, the FMCs manage all [Zip requisitions](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/zip-guide) for their regions. For contracts or invoices ready to submit for approval, the FMM will open an issue utilizing the [`Contract_Request`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/issues/new?issuable_template=Contract_Request) template and follow the instructions to provide important details required before assigning to the regional FMC. SLA for FMC to complete the Contract Request issue is 3 business days from the date all needed info is filled out by the FMM in the Contract Request issue. FMM to leave a note if turnaround is urgent (FMCs have been averaging 1-2 business days currently).

# Suggesting an Event or Tactic

If you are interested in requesting Field Marketing's support for a particular in-person or virtual event or tactic, please follow the process listed on our [Events Page](/handbook/marketing/events/#suggesting-an-event).

# [Field Marketing planning](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xtePKOl4RSINaPPr3InQNisYTQyOJ5JE)

It is our goal to have planning for each qtr completed four (4) weeks before the next quarter starts. At this time, we have the following time line set for regional plans:

- Q1 plan is due Jan 13
- Q2 plan is due April 3
- Q3 plan is due July 3
- Q4 plan is due Oct 2

A standard deck will also be used to ensure consistency across the world in terms of how the plan is presented.

The SSOT of the plan remains in GitLab on our [various issue boards](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#whats-currently-scheduled-in-my-region).

- [FY24 Standard deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-dscjXd0g-t9RmaWcgBACFb4pCp7wNlo6uRSpd55cb8/edit?usp=sharing).
    - Note: The deck is additive. You are only responsible for completing the slides that are due for the quarter we are in.
    - As the slides are due one (1) month before the end of the quarter.
    - The completed deck should be stored in your correct regions [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xtePKOl4RSINaPPr3InQNisYTQyOJ5JE). Anyone within GitLab has access to search and find this folder.

## Field Marketing QBRs
Shortly following the day that the regional plans are due, each region will hold its own QBR. The regional Manager of Field Marketing will be responsible for setting up this meeting and inviting the necessary team members. The point of the QBR is for the Field Marketing Manager to share their qtrly long plans with their SDR Manager colleagues, Field Marketing colleagues, and Field Marketing Leadership. This time together is meant to be informative and also educational to all who are attending.

This deck should also be used to present the regional plans to the sales teams.

### FMM QBR attendees

| Regional attendees:                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|

| Regional Campaign Manager (optional)  |
| Anyone else the Manager of FMM REGION deems necessary |

## Next Steps after Quarterly  plans are complete
In an effort to share the FMM team plans with the rest of the marketing team, the below steps will be followed.

### Marketing Calendar
Within two days of the FMM plan being [locked by Finance](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/marketing-finance/#important-dates) in Allocadia, the Director of Field Marketing will download the team's plans from Allocadia and will upload to the shared [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar).

If any dates change after the upload has happened the FMC will make the date update within the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar).

In order to ensure the formulas carry over properly, the download from Allocadia will need to be cleaned, similiar to how we clean our leads for list upload. 

The [Calendar cleaner spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XsjDlnAJ_lmWysIcD1XSL1JT3R0awDUd_7MRCGgMgs/edit#gid=777223734&range=A1) should be used to do this. Once the data is cleaned, it then can be copied into the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar). 

[Video walk through on how to clean.](https://youtu.be/xiABH1Gjkw4) *on GitLab Unfiltered.  

### Channel plans 
All plans with the various channel partners can be found within the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar). 

### Asks into Digital Campaigns
Details on how Field Marketing shares quarterly plans with the Digital team can be [found here](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/digital-strategy-management/).

### Asks into Product Marketing 
~~By the 15th of the 3rd month of the quarter, all asks for the Portfolio Marketing team for the upcoming quarter should be opened up for their review. Following their process outlined here. It's the responsibility of each FMM to ensure their asks are in by this time. The ~Field Marketing label must be added to the request in order for the PM team to review. We will use [this list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/strategic-marketing/product-marketing/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Field+Marketing&label_name%5B%5D=sm_request&scope=all&sort=due_date&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93) to review.~~ 

This section is WIP as we have new team members and will need to build a new process. 

#### Asks into the Customer Reference team
After the quarterly FMM plans have been added to the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar), the regional Manager of FMM will set up an alignemnt meeting with the Director of Market Strategy & Insights. The regional FMMs as well as the regional customer reference manager should also be invited to this meeting. During this meeting, the team will review asks into the [Customer reference team](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/customer-advocacy/) and agree on asks for the quarter.

You will note in Allocadia in the details panel if you need a customer speaker. [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/VYwBXmpJrDg) (you must be logged into GitLab Unfiltered to view.)

### Asks into BDR org
After the quarterly FMM plans have been added to the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar), the regional Manager of FMM will set up an alignemnt meeting with the Regional Manager of BDR and Director, Sales Dev Operations. The regional FMMs as well as the regional managers should also be invited to this meeting. During this meeting, the team will review asks into the BDR org. Further details on this process can be [found here.](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#approvals-required)

You will note in Allocadia in the details panel if you need BDR support. [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/VYwBXmpJrDg) (you must be logged into GitLab Unfiltered to view.)

### Asks into the SA org
After the quarterly FMM plans have been added to the [marketing calendar](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar), the regional Manager of FMM will set up an alignemnt meeting with the Regional Manager of SAs. The regional FMMs as well as the regional managers should also be invited to this meeting. During this meeting, the team will review asks into the SA org.

# Field Marketing/Channel Marketing Engagement and GTM Strategy

GitLab launched its [channel sales program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/) in April 2020.

As part of that program, each Channel Account Manager (CAM) will have a maximum of 3-5 Select Channel partners for [P0 and P1 regions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/localization/#priority-countries). The complete list of Select Channel Partners are identified in SFDC [here](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6). (*Please note, SFDC is the SSOT for our roster of Select Partners.)

GitLab will continuously iterate on Select Partners, so it is a best practice to check the [SFDC list](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aSq6) frequently. Each regional Field Marketing Manager should work closely with their CAM to become familiar with the Select Partners within their respective regions and their core competencies.

In order for a GitLab Partner to reach Select status, the Select Partner must:
- Have a fully executed Partner contract in place
- Have been fully onboarded/enabled and certified for both sales and technical ability to adequately represent GitLab
- Have a working business plan (developed with the GitLab CAM) for the next 2 quarters (at minimum) that clearly outlines what and where the Select partner will be focusing in on (e.g., what kind of practices will they be standing up: DevOps, DevSecOps, GitOps, etc., market segment, vertical industry, geographic territory if applicable.)

## Field Marketing initiated and funded campaigns

Jointly with their regionally algined CAM, Field Marketers should be executing 50% of their in region campaigns with Select level regional partners. The primary goal of this activity is to convert MQLs to PSOs.

In order for FMM to engage in lead generation activity, the CAM needs to fill out the [Channel Lead Gen request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Channel_LeadGen_Req).

Detailed planning process is [outlined here](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#quarterly-planning-field-and-channel). Week by week details can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zCdPuLz5EhpM2s1thAGW8uZ785QwmdbE5z56cq59ZXo/edit#gid=0&range=A1).

Note: The Channel Partner Enablement team is the DRI to make sure each Select Partner is fully enabled prior to FMM engagement. FMMs should not be involved in any channel enablement.

Select Partner marketing activities can be:
- Fully funded by FMM budget
- Funded jointly by FMM budget and Select Partner
- Funded jointly by FMM, GitLab MDF (see [MDF process](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/#requesting-mdf-funds)) and Select Partner

### Sample types of activities to engage with Select Partners

- Workshops
- Webcast / Lunch and Learn programs
- Account Acceleration Programs
- Direct Mail Programs
- Surveys

### Lead Management in the Channel

Please refer to the [Channel Partner Joint GitLab events handbook page](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/partner-campaigns/#joint-gitlab-and-partner-events) for details on how we set up our joint campaign and also lead sharing with the channel as a result of those campaings.

All campaigns we are working with channel partners must flow through the outlined process as a way to ensure we are tracking the success of the campaign properly.

### Tracking success of FMM campaigns with Channel

Please refer to the [Channel ROI section](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-roi-to-gitlab-channel).

### Useful Fields in SFDC that relate to Vartopia
1. Please refer to [this handbook page](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/vartopia/#sfdc-partner-prospect-admin) for further details.

# Field Marketing - Public Sector

## Charitable Donations for Event Attendance

As incentive for attending an event, GitLab can promote and process a monetary donation per participant to a charitable organization. For example: GitLab promotes a $25 donation per attendee for attending an event, 100 attendees participate in the event and GitLab donates $2,500 to the selected charity. **Please Note**: Donations are not to be made in a participant's name or reference a participant's organization.

## PubSec FMM Calendar share
In alignment with the PubSec team's [process to lock down shared data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/okrs/-/issues/150) that is accessible to teams outside of our US PubSec team - (will link to handbook page once its been created!) the Public Sector Field Marketing Managers, by default, will mark their calendar details as private. Google calendar [has a feature](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en#zippy=%2Cunderstand-permission-settings-for-shared-calendars%2Cstop-sharing-your-calendar-publicly-with-your-organization-or-with-specific-people) that allows you to share your calendar with individuals once its been marketed as private and at a minimum, the FMM team member should share their calendar with both their direct manager as well as their aligned Field Marketing Specialist, pending those people are US Citizens.

## PubSec Website

Please see the PubSec website page [here](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/public-sector/).

### How to Edit the PubSec Website

The content for the PubSec page lives in the `Buyer Experience` repository, in the [public-sector.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-experience/buyer-experience/-/blob/main/content/solutions/public-sector.yml#L240) file (starting around line 240). To edit this file, please keep the same structure as the current content to avoid any errors. Feel free to use the Web IDE or single file editor to update the information.

The event cards section of the file will look something like this:
```

# Working with Field Marketing

## Requests to Field Marketing leadership team

If you are a Field Marketing Manager and you would like to make a request in order to achieve better business results aligned to our values, please submit an issue using the [Field Marketing Leadership request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leadership_request).

FM leadership team will review all requests on a bi-weekly basis, and will prioritize as necessary or will share with you relevant issues if the request is already being worked on.

**Why we use this template:**
Funneling similar requests from a global team and addressing shared pain points in a single issue with a [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) will help to reduce noise and churn for other teams we collaborate with and ideally helps to improve a process that works for the WW Field organisation.

This issue should not be used as a shortcut to get questions answered but for request where FM leadership can help to improve a process which does contribute to our success as a team.

# The Field Marketing Budget

Field Marketing manages its budget in [Allocadia](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/). Specific instructions on how we manage our expenses:

1. Each FMM will have a quarterly allocation of money to spend based on territory pipeline needs.
1. Every month on t -6 days (so 6 business days before the start of the next month) finance will do a pull of this data and push it into the company planning tool called Adaptive. Field Marketing Managers must always keep their budgets up to date, but it is essential the budget is accurate for the month prior to t -6 days, as FMM Leadership reviews the budget vs. actuals on a monthly basis.
   * Via Geekbot, each FMM will receive a reminder t-8 days before the start of the next month - or 2 days before the monthly forecast is due to Finance.
1. Direct Mail accrual process - Spend should be planned and expensed in the month in which they are sent out to recipients vs. the month in which the recipient could use the direct mail piece, as we have no control over when a gift card (as an example) is used.
1. Survey accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to complete a survey, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 surveys, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for surveys were completed, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1.
   * This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison
1. Content Syndication accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to run a content syndication play, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 leads, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for leads were delivered, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1.
   * This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison
1. The entire cost of the program is to be forecasted for - Sponsorship + lead scanners + monitor + any other auxiliary cost that the company will incur.
1. If the event is just 1 day, then the start and end date would be the same.
1. Any expense that is less than $5,000 USD will be expensed against your budget in the month it is paid. This is in alignment with our [GitLab Prepaid Expense Policy](/handbook/finance/accounting/#prepaid-expense-policy). It is essential that you have this expense in the correct month within Allocadia.
1. For expenses more than $5,000 USD (also in alignment with our Accounting rules), we recognize the expense in the month when the work happens, NOT when we the cash leaves our doors.
   * As such, when you are running paid digital ads to support campaign work, you must account for the spend in a separate line item (this is aligned with our practice of [creating separate line items for each individual invoice/spend](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#buttons). You will keep the same campaign name for the digital spend, but you will need to account for the different vendor and different time frame in the additional line item.
1. If you are running a campaign that has more than one tactic, and there are specific dates for the tactics, then each tactic will need its own line item in Allocadia.
    - As an example: If you are running a country specific campaign on CI/CD and there are 2 webinars and a workshop included in that campaign with a different specific date, then each webinar and the workshop will need its own tag, in addition to its own line item in the budget.
1. Each folder in Allocadia is protected based on the managers/DRI's for each region. Only those with permissions will be able to edit each folder. Please reach out in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders slack channel if you need permissions updated.
1. At times, expenses are shared across an entire region. These expenses are housed in the ALL region folders. Any activity plans should transfer money to the ALL folder when looking to share the cost of expense. The same expense should NOT live in multiple activity plans if its an expense that is shared amongst more than 1 activity plan.
   * As an example: If all regions within AMER want to collaborate on the same campaign and they each want to spend $5k on the campaign, the FMMs would use the [transfer budget feature within Allocadia](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#request-transfer) to transfer that money into the All AMER activity plan. Once in All AMER,  the correct sub-geos should be selected in the details panel so its clear how this campaign will support the different regions/sub-geos. Transferring to the All folders also prevents FMMs from having to divide out the MQLs amongst the various regions as well for ROI calculation purposes.
   * In order for the shared activity to be pulled into the regional pipeline reporting for QBRs, the FMM will need to remember to also select the ALL folder in addition to their activity plan name in order to pull their full plan noted in [reports 3 & 4 here.](/handbook/marketing/strategy-performance/allocadia/#reports-field-marketing-uses)
   * [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/w3Vs5lbBogU) - must be logged into YouTube Unfiltered
   * SFDC campaign owner will be the specific DRI for the overall campaign if running a shared campaign.
1. When splitting a tactic between territories, all money should be transferred to one activity plan and the PO should be raised from that one line item.
1. For budgeting purposes we need to stipulate the amount in USD (as we currently operate in USD) in the FMM budget. Allocadia does have a multicurrency function where you right click in the planned or forecasted sections and the converstion amount is compelted for you pulling exchange rates that are loaded on the back end by our finance team.
1. VAT and GST does not need to be included into budget planning as these do not attribute to program expenses, however sales tax in the US does.
1. As it relates to procurement issues being approved, it is essential that the contract details are submitted with the procurement issue, that way the approver is clear about what they are signing off on.
    - We aim for an MQL to not cost us more than $500, should a contract be submitted that is over the $500 goal, there needs to be a documented reason + path to success shown in the procurement issue. It is the responsibility of the FMM Country Manager to ensure this documentation is listed in the procurement issue before the issue is sent on to further leadership to review/approve. For C-level and other campaign where we target decision makers, the customer journey needs to be documented and we acknowledge that the MQL might be higher.

## Customer Speaker Gifts

Please note that there is a limit of $75 USD annually per person on customer speaker gifts.

# Field Marketing and Legal

## Legal Approvals

Field Marketing executes contracts with outside vendors to support the work we do. We do so by following the company [procure to pay process](/handbook/finance/procurement/). All legal approvals will flow this process.

It should be a rare occasion (and not a result of poor planning), that a contract would need to be urgently (less than 5 business days) turned around. Only after all FMM approvals have happened, should the FMC ping legal on slack asking them to please approve an urgent ask.

## Sweepstakes

Field Marketing follows the legal team's process [here](/handbook/legal/marketing-collaboration/#promotional-games) for contests and sweepstakes.

## Working with vendors that are brand new
New vendors are popping up frequently and in the spirit of iteration and testing, the Field Marketing team at time may want to engage with a vendor that is brand new to the space (remember, at one point in time way back in 2011, GitLab the company was brand new too!). You should work with your leader to assess these opportunties. To ensure we are protecting our own company, you should follow these steps when working with a brand new vendor:

1.  If contacted via social media or other manner by an unknown individual and/or individual(s) related to an event, review all event/program materials, including a detailed review of the organizers website to confirm past events. In addition, review various social media materials.
1. If an event is unknown, new or first time, the Team Member can engage with Alliance and Channel Team Members to gather feedback on the events organizer and ensure value, use your netowrk internally and ask around if folks know this vendor.
- Where applicable, request details and documentation related to previous event(s) hosted by the organizer.
- In situations where an organizer is hosting an inaugural event, Team Members can ask for other partners / sponsors who are participating, and receive direct confirmation from the event space host (e.g, hotel).
- In situations with first events, the field marketing team can engage the GitLab Legal Team for additional review.
- [Video walk through](https://youtu.be/Ao-HUl15c1A) with our legal team outlining this process can be found on GitLab Unfiltered.

- The team meets on the 1st Thursday of each month.
- All team members are invited to each call although, if the call is scheduled outside of the team member's normal working hours, the team member is NOT expected to attend. The calendar invite simply serves as a reminder to the team member to check out the recording of the meeting the next working day and to also review the agenda.
- The purpose of the team call is to share relevant company, marketing, and Field Marketing announcements.
- Anyone on the team should feel empowered to add content to the team meeting agenda.
- We will also have a specific `lessons learned` section where each Country Field Marketing Manager will select 1 FMM event or other tactic event recap to review.
    - The FMM who is the DRI for the event or other tactic we will be reviewing as a team will add the `Event Recap` link from the `Event Planning and Recap` to the agenda
    - We review the recap prior to the call, the FMM DRI briefly gives a run down of the event or other tactic, then we dialogue.
    - Each region will be represented - AMER, APAC, and EMEA - so we will review 3 each call.
- We also discuss use cases - could be how you've worked with social media, how you built a report in SFDC to help the team be more efficient, etc,
- Guest Speakers - at times we will also invite other colleagues from the company to address our team as a whole
- As a handbook first company, if you are going to bring a topic to the team, please think twice on if you should add just an agenda item, or if you should add an agenda item that links to an MR or a handbook page.
- If you're not on the Field Marketing team at GitLab and you're a GitLab employee who's interested in joining our team meeting, please feel free to ask in the #fieldmarketing slack room, we'd welcome the opportunity to host you!

## Async Status Updates

Since we are a [remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) company, we utilize a Slack plugin called [Geekbot](https://geekbot.io/) to coordinate status updates. Field Marketing world wide currently conducts 1 weekly standup. Geekbot shares this update in the public #im-hangout slack room.

## Weekly Status Update

The **Weekly Status Update** is configured to run at 9 AM local time on Monday, and contains a series of rotating questions. Below is an example of questions you may see:

1. _**What was your favorite part of the weekend?**_
The goal with this question is for you to get to know your colleagues and for you to be able to share what excited you from the previous few days when you weren't working.
1. <i>**Are you traveling anywhere this week? If so, where and why.**</i> <--- This question is paused for the moment. :)
As Field Marketers, we travel up to 50% of the time. Sharing where you are is important, especially if are in a different timezone.
1. _**What are your top 1-3 priorities for the next week?**_
These top 3 priorities should be focused on what you plan to accomplish that week.
1. _**Anything blocking your progress?**_
Of those 1-3 items listed, do you need any roadblocks removed in order to accomplish the priorities?
1. A question that is related to which [GitLab Value](/handbook/values/) we are focusing on for the month.

You will be notified via the Geekbot plug in on slack at 9 AM your local time on Mondays, as stated above. It is important to note, that unless you answer all questions in the Geekbot plug in, your answers will NOT be shared with your colleagues, so please be sure to complete all questions!

## Out of Office Processes
We follow the processes documented in the [Communicating your time off section](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off) of our handbook page.

Specifically: 
1. Add your OOO to PTO by Deel 
1. Add an OOO for your email 
1. Turn on [Google Calendar's "out of office" setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) (scroll down to "Show when you’re out of office") to create an out of office event that will automatically decline new and existing meetings for you.
1. Add an OOO to your Slack profile
1. Ad an OOO to your GitLab profile and mark yourself as `busy`
1. If you are a manager of people, please [assign a delegate in Coupa](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/#how-to-add-a-delegate-in-coupa) so you will not hold approvals while you're enjoying your time off.

# Field Marketing MR process

Everyone can contribute, although not everyone has merge rights. Within the Field Marketing team, when someone submits an MR, the submitter needs to assign to their direct line manager to review, and then their manager will assign to the Director of Field Marketing to review. Once the Director has reviewed/approved, it is their responsibility to ensure all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then merge.

Should a Country Manager of Field Marketing or Director of Field Marketing submit a process change in the handbook, then all Country Managers should sign off via approving the MR or commenting their approval. At which point, the Director ensures all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then the Director will merge.

# Creating a spif for sales
At times, Field Marketers may want to create a SPIF (sales performance incentive fund) to help drive sales behavior in a campaign they are running. While this should not be our standard to offer a SPIF, should one need to be used, we do need to report back to payroll any incentve that was paid and to who. The process is as follows:
1. There is no payment threshold that would not need to be reported. All SPIFs must be reported.
1. The SPIF DRI should send the legal name of the winners to payroll
1. The SPIF DRI should include the amount of money (or value of the prize, if a prize was offered) to payroll
1. Contact info for payroll can be found [here on their handbook page](/handbook/finance/payroll/).

## Printfection Direct Mail Giveaways

<details markdown="1">

<summary>We will be deprecating usage of Printfection and will use Reachdesk or our selected swag vendor for direct mail. Expand below to see details regarding Printfection</summary>


The below steps can be followed to set up and run a giveaway campaign using Printfection for field marketing. If you come across any steps that you can’t follow in Printfection, post in the [#swag Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C66R8N98F) so a Community Advocate can update your permissions levels.

1. Register and send the items you will be using to Printfection by following [these steps](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/)
1. Bundle your items together by creating a [Giveaway Kit](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006335613-How-to-start-a-new-kit) in Printfection
    - The picture of the Giveaway Kit is what the customer will see. If you’d like a different image to show than what Printfection puts together as a preview, be sure to provide this to the support team
    - Select Standard packaging or choose to create a custom box (a new custom box will incur additional expenses). If you’d like to use already created custom packaging (such as the GitLab branded Poly Mailers), check with the advocates in the #swag slack channel to make sure it’s okay for you to use
1. Set up a [Giveaway Campaign](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/)
    - [Add the kit](https://help.printfection.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026589734-Using-kits-in-Giveaway-campaigns) you created as an item in the Giveaway Campaign
    - The name of the giveaway campaign will be visible to the customer
    - Change from Paused to Running when you’re ready to run the campaign
1. Add a Printfection code column to your event spreadsheet with your leads. Copy over unique codes (generated above in the Printfection Giveaway Campaign) to assign a code to each lead
1. Work with your MPM to set up the Printfection URL & unique codes in your email copy (if desired, steps 5-7 are only relevant if sending a Marketo email rather than individually distributing the redemption links):
    - Place the Giveaway Campaign URL in your email copy (found on the Overview tab of the campaign in Printfection)
    - A custom Marketo field will be used to append the unique Printfection codes to the URL for each lead (example of how it works [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/1195#note_325404319)) and to place the code under the URL
1. Complete list upload prior to the email send date (example list upload [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/2343))
1. Work with your MPM to determine post redemption email needs. The options are follow up email and an automated confirmation email. The confirmation email triggers upon redemption of codes, the follow up email is sent at one time to a group of recipients. If an automated confirmation email is needed, define what status in SFDC should trigger the follow up email
using the Direct Mail campaign status progressions. (for example, when a person's campaign status changes to `Queued` it could trigger a confirmation email and when the status changes to `Shipped` the SDRs will begin follow up sequence (example [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/1195#follow-up-planned-from-field-marketing-fmc))
1. Once all above steps are complete, the Giveaway Campaign is ready to run. Make sure the Giveaway is changed from Paused to Running if you did not do this already in Step 3
1. When the campaign is running, monitor Redemptions, Shipping, and Costs under the Giveaway Campaign Overview in Printfection
    - Update redemptions/shipments in event spreadsheet if needed to notify SDRs (add additional columns to track)
    - Update SFDC status for leads once they redeem a code or item is shipped, depending on what was decided in Step 7
1. When a campaign is over and you no longer need the items in Printfection, follow [these steps](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/) to remove items from Printfection. If inventory is not yet 0, you will need to ship the items back to yourself/desired recipient before archiving. Until this is done, $25/month will still be charged per item. If relevant, the MPM must be instructed as to when the printfection codes are no longer needed on person records. This will signal that the MPM can now run a batch smart campaign to remove the printfection codes from the person records, thus freeing up the custom field for use in the future.

**Fees Involved:**

- Cost of the items you are using in the giveaway
- Fulfillment and shipping fees for each order placed once the giveaway is running (there is a Cost Estimate under campaign settings but please note actuals have ended up higher than their estimate so far) These will be on a Printfection invoice, more details to come on the invoice process.
- $25/month per item stocked in Printfection. This will not hit your field marketing Allocadia ID, but is an overall cost to GitLab to consider and be mindful of (noted in Step 12 [here](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/)

## Account-Centric Micro-Campaign

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Expand below to see details regarding Account-Centric Micro-Campaigns</summary>


The purpose of the regional integrated micro-campaign is to build and drive a specific strategy in a region (with a specific list of targeted accounts/look-a-like accounts). This could be based on intent data pulled from our ABM tool, DemandBase, or it could be based on accounts you’ve agreed to target with your SAL. A micro-campaign must include a minimum of 2 different account-centric tactics.

**For example:**

- If you are planning a virtual Lunch & Learn and want to utilize LinkedIn InMail as well, those 2 account-centric tactics together make up a micro-campaign. However, if you are planning a Lunch & Learn on its own without any additional tactics, that is just considered an [Individual Tactic](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#individual-tactics).

### What does Account-Centric mean?

At times, Field Marketing will run an account-centric approach to its in-region campaigns. Account-Centric is an approach where both sales and marketing are focusing their efforts on a very specific list of targeted accounts in order to increase engagement and ultimately pipeline creation within this list of accounts. The SAL/FMM/SDR are responsible for outlining which accounts are account-centric and accounts can easily pop in and out of being in the account-centric play based on the strategy that’s being executed.
i.e. If a FMM is targeting to get 15 people into an interactive roundtable discussion, that will greatly impact the number of accounts that are targeted for that specific tactic vs if they were trying to 100+ people into that same discussion.

### How to track the ROI of your Account-Centric approach

In order to track engagement, you need to start with a baseline and over time, track the progress on how engaged that account is with us. Right now this is a manual process where this [SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004e4Ll) should be modified by pulling in all the accounts that are in the account-centric GTM Strategy per rep and then you must take a snap shot in time (SFDC does not allow for historical data pulls) by exporting the data and saving to a gsheet. [Example of gsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7xxoKcXW3Lq8eXIPg5KIOMGXIItp7MEZeBXAFfszOI/edit#gid=206509375&range=A1). Depending on your campaign, you can export this data on a weekly or monthly cadence to monitor progress.

In order to change the GTM Strategy field for accounts in SFDC from `Volume` to `Account-Centric`, you can employ two options: a) Change the GTM Strategy field for each account manually if you have <20 accounts in the campaign, or b) Create a MOps request to have all accounts changed from `Volume` to `Account-Centric` in bulk. To request the bulk adjustment, please utilize [this MOps template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=abm_bulk_update_request).

Account-Centric is different from Account Based Marketing in the sense that ABM focuses on accounts as markets of one versus account-centric targeting a group of accounts. At GitLab we run a 3-Tiered approach to ABM focused around our ICP and target 100-150 accounts in our ABM strategy at any given time. For complete details on how GitLab runs its Account Based Marketing, please head to the [GitLab ABM page](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/).

At GitLab, we utilize Bizible for attribution tracking. In order to track the touchpoints of your campaign, modify [this linear IACV SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aDSN) . This report shows Opportunity: Incremental ACV and Linear iACV.

- If your campaign has a SFDC campaign with leads associated to it, then you will pull in the SFDC Field `Salesforce Campaign` equals .
- If your campaign does NOT have a SFDC Campaign with leads associated OR you also are wanting to track the opportunities from your digital spend, then you would add in the SFDC `Ad Campaign Name` equals . We use the same UTM per channel, so all channels (paid ads, LinkedIn Mail, DemandBase, etc.) will pull all influenced iacv. Stay tuned for more details on Bizible.

### Account-Centric Micro-Campaign Team

- Field Marketing Manager - overarching DRI responsible for opening [the micro-campaign issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Micro_Campaign_and_Individual_Tactics), reviewing the intent data from the ABM DRI, and building the strategy based on what the intent data is suggesting (i.e. are a lot of folks searching to Kubernetes? Is it digital transformation? What call to action do we have? Do you want a direct mail piece involved? Do you want to drive to an On-Demand or scheduled webcast?), owning, and driving the mico-campaign, including epic and issue creation and communicating timelines and actions needed of other team members with relevant SLAs from request to delivery.
- Account Based Marketing (ABM) Manager - will work with FMM to produce target account list based on intent data and known targets & will also lead strategy session with Demandbase Campaign Manager, should the FMM decided its part of the strategy to deploy ads via Demandbase.
- Sales Development Rep (SDR) - Will assist in building out the actual target people & build Outreach cadence to support agreed upon CTA.
- Digital Marketing Programs - Can assist in deploying paid digital strategies (ex: display ads, paid search, paid social, and/or paid publisher placement) and geo focused ads via our digital agency. They can also help get our digital agency involved should the FMM want to engage with the agency.
- Marketing Program Managers - Setup of Marketo and Salesforce campaigns with correct program type to support the tactic. Guidance on system tracking, and setup of Marketo email follow up. Facilitate new program types with MOps and other MPMs as necessary.

### Steps for the Creation and Organization of Micro-Campaign Epics & Issues

#### 1. FMM opens overarching issue

<i>FMM opens a field marketing issue using the [Micro-Campaign and Individual Tactics Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Micro_Campaign_and_Individual_Tactics)</i>, listing the tactics to be used from the list below in step 2. At this point, the issue is in `PLAN` stage.

**WHY? The purpose of opening the overarching micro-campaign issue is to discuss the plan with any teams that would require work and gain agreement on SLAs before opening epics and issues.** _Remember - as of today, epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template._

**Here is what needs to be included before moving from `PLAN` to `WIP`:**

- Agreement on SLAs and scope between other teams involved in selected tactics - [SLA workback doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280)
- Formulation of a clear strategy and understanding of customer journey
- Completion of all fields in the `Details` section of the micro-campaign template

_For anything that’s listed in the `Tactics included` section of the template the FMM needs to be clear about their specific ask & what the desired outcome will be. If the FMM does not know, it's ok to set up a call to talk through ideas and strategies._

#### 2. FMM opens specific tactic issues

_FMM opens additional issues relevant to their micro-campaign, if required._

**WHY? The purpose of opening the issue is so that each individual tactic shows up on the FMM boards.** _Remember - as of today, Epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template._

**Issue Templates for Each Tactic:**
Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list [**HERE**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for a comprehensive list of templates to be utilized for each tactic.

#### 3. FMM creates tactic epics

_FMM follows the instructions for epic creation based on the tactics decided._

**WHY? The purpose of opening the epics and issues is to organize the campaign in GitLab with the epic being equivalent to the project/campaign and issues being equivalent to the tactical execution steps to complete the campaign.**

**How to create the epic:**

- Where to create the epic: [Marketing Epic Repo](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics?sort=created_desc)
- How to create the epic: Click "New Epic" at the top right of the screen
- What to name the epic: The naming convention is listed in the epic code for each specific tactic.
- What to choose as the due date: this should be the same as your micro-campaign issue due date. For example - If your micro-campaign involves 3 different tactics and the last tactic is set to close out on December 5, 2020, that should be your due date.
- How to link the epic to the issue: In your epic click on Epics + Issues - Add - Add an existing issue - Link your issue

**Micro-Campaign Epic Code**
This epic will include the general details of your micro-campaign.

```
<--- Name this epic using the following format, then delete this line: [Micro-Campaign Tactic Name] - [3-letter Month] [Date], [Year] --->

## [Micro-Campaign Issue >>]()

## :notepad_spiral: Details
(copy and pasted from your micro-campaign issue)

/label ~"mktg-status::wip" ~"Field Marketing" ~"FMM-MicroCampaign" ~"FMM-Other Tactics"
```
**Epic Codes for Each Tactic:**
Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list [**HERE**](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing-campaign-issue-templates-epic-codes-and-progression-status) for a comprehensive list of epic codes to be utilized for each tactic.

#### 4. FMM creates relevant issues and assigns DRIs and due dates

_At this point the FMM has the main issue (for agreement by teams), the tactic issue(s) (to show up on boards), and the tactic epics (to capture overarching tactic plan and organize issues). Now FMMs will create the issues to request the work and timeline of teams involved in each tactic._

In each epic code (from step 3), there are issue template links included that indicate what issues need to be created (example - follow up email, facilitate tracking, etc.) - if they do not say "optional" then they are required. The FMM will create each issue and link to the epic so that all tactical issues are organized together clearly in GitLab.

The FMM will designate DRI as indicated and set due dates based on SLAs for each item that is being requested. [SLA workback sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXriQ1clvYyBn-TDbbCVvNP6NEbrAF-0w6tIHKhDeZM/edit#gid=1983708280) is available to help you.

**Note: This is essentially creating the work-back execution plan using issues, DRIs, and due dates.**
If the date of the tactic is changed, the FMM is responsible for updating the due dates of all issues accordingly. It is also important to remember that the DRIs on the issues are not notified when due dates are added. If you create an issue and then add due dates at a later time (or change due dates), please remember to ping the DRIs in the issue so they are aware dates have been added or changed.

#### 5. Organizing Epics

Your micro-campaign issue and epic is an overview of your micro-campaign strategy and each individual tactic supporting the micro-campaign requires its own issue and epic. When you add individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic, the micro-campaign epic automatically becomes the [Parent Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#relationships-between-epics-and-issues). Each individual tactic epic, when nested under the micro-campaign epic, automatically becomes the [Child Epic](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/#relationships-between-epics-and-issues). Whichever epic you nest the other epics under will automatically become the Parent Epic, so remember to always add your individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic and not the other way around.

For example - You have created a micro-campaign that will include a self-service event with promotion, a survey, LinkedIn InMail, and DemandBase targeted ads.

- You will create an epic for your micro-campaign per the [above instructions](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#3-fmm-creates-tactic-epics).
- Your self-service event with promotion will require a separate issue with its own epic.
- Your survey will also require a separate issue with its own epic.
- Your LinkedIn InMail will require its own issue (the only DMP tactic that currently requires an epic is Content Syndication).
- Your DemandBase ads will require its own issue (ABM tactics do not currently require epics).

**To organize your various tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic:**

- Click into your micro-campaign epic
- Scroll down to Epics & Issues
- Click Add an Epic
- Paste the epics from your other tactics into this section and GitLab will automatically organize the tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic

### FAQ's - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics

1. If I am only running 1 tactic, do I need to create the micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least [2 account centric tactics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#account-centric-micro-campaign).
1. If I want to run ads through our ABM vendor do I need to create a micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least [2 account centric tactics](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#account-centric-micro-campaign). Ads with our ABM vendor is only 1 tactic.

### Reminders - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics

1. **Labels** - be aware of your labels. Please be mindful that you're adding the correct labels.
1. Epic label issue - There is a glitch right now which may keep the labels from auto-assigning. In order to have the labels added to your epic, you'll need to copy the /label line from the epic code into a comment to pull over all labels. [Quick video how-to](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gK8G4CBaqcgWgB6b2A1BRSQCma5GfJyt). 2 mins
1. If you create an epic & sub issues and DO NOT have a date, then when you go back and add dates then you MUST ping the assigners - could be FMC, MPM, OPS, etc.
1. When you go from plan to WIP that's when everything starts - from the SLA workback as well.
1. The details section is so important - what that tells the MPM/FMC how this program should flow. You can't move your issue to the WIP stage until the details are added - This is where if attention to detail isn’t your BFF, you need to make it your BFF. ;)

These custom built surveys are developed via collaboration with GitLab sellers, Product Marketing, and Sales Development Reps, where the aim is to target accounts to create actionable sales intelligence which reveals an account’s needs, pain, plans and trends. In addition, GatePoint Research provides an incentive of a free gift upon completing the survey.

Our strategy is to leverage the data from the survey responses as well as the Pulse Report provided to set meetings and create sales-accepted opportunities. The data gathered from the surveys will also help the Digital Marketing Team and Campaign Managers by providing insight into the respondents current state of DevOps use and strategy as well as pain points and challenges.

#### Regions that Utilize Simply Direct
At this time, SimplyDirect is only used by our AMER Field Marketing team.

#### Successful Usage
Strategic success is contingent upon close alignment and communication between Marketing and Sales. Marketing will work collaboratively with Sales, Product Marketing and Campaign Managers to develop the survey. Best practice for the survey is 10 questions max. SDR’s will create a follow-up Outreach sequence to leverage when reaching out to those who’ve completed the survey.

Once the survey is complete, SDR’s will leverage the individual results and work with their SAL to:
- Identify points of interest in the survey pertaining to each individual response (i.e. pain points, number of tools, etc)
- Create a strategy based on matching those issues with GitLab offerings
- Customize their outreach communications to initiate conversations towards setting a IQM

#### Personas
Our focus will be geared towards key-decision makers or fellow team members who can help push to key decision makers. This opens up our outreach to anyone in DevOps, DevSecOps, IT and other related fields with titles ranging from Developer Team Lead to Executives.

Examples of personas/titles include: Director/VP of Engineering, Director / VP of Machine Learning (or AI), Director/VP of Enterprise Architecture, Director/VP of Product Development/Engineering, VP of Digital Transformation, Director of Applications, Director of Security (Information Security, IT Security, Application Security), VP of Operations.

#### Phases for SimplyDirect
- **Phase 1:** Sales and Marketing create the survey and share the target accounts and personas with SimplyDirect. Upon completion, SimplyDirect sends out the survey and shares survey results with the GitLab team via the SimplyDirect portal. The account list shared with SimplyDirect has an SDR assigned to each account so the tool will send the assigned SDR an email notifying them when a survey is completed. FMM will share the portal website, username, and password in the issue for SDRs or SALs to access survey results and analytics. FMM will also provide SDRs with training before launch on how to navigate the portal and share SimplyDirect's best practices. This phase is considered complete once the predetermined number of survey responses is achieved (number of responses will be identified in the SOW). Please note that a gift is sent to survey respondents by SimplyDirect as a thank you for completing the survey (Example: Columbia Jacket/Fleece). SimplyDirect also creates a detailed Pulse Report with survey results when the phase is completed and provides it to GitLab along with a list of high-intent targets who did not complete the survey (see Phase 3 details on how to utilize these additional targets). Access to the portal is not indefinite so a report should be pulled from the SimplyDirect portal in order to add survey responses to our own tracking sheet if needed.
- **Phase 2:** Leads are uploaded to SFDC automatically through our SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration and SDRs can set up an Outreach sequence to follow-up with these leads by sharing the Pulse Report. There is also an option of a swag giveaway at this phase if a meeting is booked/attended.
- **Phase 3:** SimplyDirect gathers a list of additional high-intent targets (also contracted in the SOW) that have not opted in to be contacted by GitLab directly. In order to try to capture these additional leads, we can create a Pathfactory track that requires visitors to enter in their contact information to view the track (which includes the Pulse Report and other assets). SimplyDirect includes this Pathfactory link in their follow-up email to the additional contacts. Anyone who enters their contact information in Pathfactory can be sent a follow-up by GitLab.

#### Reporting and Dashboards
SimplyDirect defines engagement by targets filling out the survey.  The SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration adds anyone who fills out the survey automatically into the salesforce campaign.
