## Public Relations (PR)/Content Trainings

### How to Make Your Content Work Harder for You

As a GitLab team member, no matter your role, you are typically actively engaging with our user community, customers, technology partners, prospects, etc. on a regular basis. Often these engagements are centered around some sort of content preparation to speak with the intended audience such as a presentation, video, speaking session at a conference or meetup, blog post on a topic or a webinar to showcase GitLab and/or technical expertise and thought leadership. 

The content amplification does not need to stop at that one event,blog post or webinar! Why not create a domino effect with your content to further the reach and increase viewership of the topic.

##### ðŸ”— [Watch the training here. You'll need to be logged into GitLab's Unfiltered YouTube account in order to access the video.](https://youtu.be/c5UcbNYVTu4)
We're aware of a typo in the middle of the session. Instead of "do no" at 4:43 and 5:46, it should be "do not". Kristen says this in the session, but the slide is missing the last letter.

To obtain a certificate, you will need to complete this [Social Media 101 Knowledge Assessment](https://forms.gle/X5toY6A1jhguYyfj8) and earn at least an 80%. Once the quiz has been passed, you will receive an email with your certificate that you can share on your personal LinkedIn or Twitter pages. If you have questions, please reach out to our L&D team at [learning@gitlab.com](mailto:learning@gitlab.com).
