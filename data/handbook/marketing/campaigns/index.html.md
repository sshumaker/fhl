## Integrated Campaigns Overview
{: #integrated-campaigns .gitlab-purple}

The goal of a GitLab integrated campaign is to strategically land a cohesive message to a target audience across a variety of channels and offers, dependent on the goals of the campaign. Content types include a combination of blog posts, webinars, whitepapers, reports, videos, case studies, and more. Activation of the campaigns takes place in a number of marketing channels include digital ads, social, paid social, SEO, PR, email, and more.

**[Campaign Managers](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/)** are responsible for the strategizing of integrated campaigns and organizing timelines and DRIs for deliverables to execute on the campaigns.

## How do we measure performance??
{: #campaign-performance .gitlab-purple}
We leverage multi-touch attribution reporting in Sisense to help us understand which campaigns, activities, and channels drive the best results, with a goal of SAO and Pipeline. We review these metrics at a segment/region breakout level, as well as reviewing overall campaign metrics with the campaign core teams to identify optimization opportunities to maximize results.

Our dashboards are owned and managed by the Marketing Strategy and Performance team. [Learn more in the Bizible Handbook >>](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/bizible)

## Campaign terminology
{: #campaign-terminology}

- **Campaign - When you hear this term used alone, please clarify what type they are referring to (see below). Please speak in specific terms to communicate more clearly.**
- Integrated Campaign - Organized by marketing campaigns team, collaborating across marketing teams toward a launch date. It incorporates multiple offers and multiple channels.
- Digital Marketing Campaign - Online marketing efforts organized by the digital marketing programs team to drive engagement, conversions, traffic, or revenue
- Brand Awareness Campaign - Higher-level print and digital marketing efforts organized by the corporate marketing team. These are focused on brand recognition.
- Salesforce Campaign - An object within Salesforce that represents different types of offers. These are less-so theoretical and more to capture touchpoints of prospects and customers.

## Campaign Planning
{: #campaign-planning .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**There will be an epic for every campaign - created by the Campaign Manager managing the campaign.**

* The campaign will have a clear launch date
* All action items will have DRIs and a timeline, working back from the launch date
* The campaign will be determined at least 45 days prior to launch to allow for a proactive, not reactive, timeline

Ideally, campaigns will be agreed at least a quarter in advance to allow for ample planning and execution, prep time with agencies, creative concepting, and communication internally. This is a collaborative effort to deliver a cohesive program.

#### Overall Campaign Steps
{: #campaign-steps}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* **Campaign need/timing determined by Marketing Leadership and Revenue Programs**
* **Assign:** Campaign Manager is assigned
* **Assign:** Marketing team leads assign DRIs from their teams
* **Organize:** Campaign Manager creates Slack channel for ongoing async communication
* **Meeting:** Campaign Manager organizes campaign kickoff call
* **Plan:** Campaign Manager creates project plan (workback) with timelines and DRIs
* **Plan:** Campaign Manager creates the epic and related issues, including the due dates and DRIs from project plan
* **Meeting:** Campaign Manager organizes the core team connect call to cover milestones met and determine any blockers/at-risk action items
* **Meeting (optional):** Campaign manager seeks budget from VP of Product Marketing if we need to engage external agencies to help build out additional content/design assets for the campaign 
* **Async:** *DRIs are responsible for delivering by their due dates, with timeline adherence being critical due to dependencies for later tasks to be completed by other teams*
* **Reporting:** Campaign Manager organizes reporting issue with clear DRI to include overall metrics and more detailed drill-in by channel (one month post-launch)
* **Optimization:** Campaign Manager creates issues for optimizing the landing page, channels, etc. and assigning to relevant DRIs

Below is a V1 visual in Mural of the sales lead funnel (pre-opportunity) on the left and the all-remote funnel on the right. Discussion of how and when to "bridge the gap" between the funnels - potentially sharing GitLab audience-targeted offers within All-Remote communications - is included [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/-/issues/2590).
