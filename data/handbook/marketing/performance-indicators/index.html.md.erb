## Coming in FY22: New Marketing KPIs

In Q4, we will be working through deprecating many (but not all) of the marketing KPIs below in order to move to new KPIs that we believe better map to what teams can actually impact. Here are the new KPIs, and the next step is to work with the data team to update this page.

## Performance Indicators

1. `In Contact`: Defined by having 1 contact at each organization that we could reach out to - with 10k developers. See also [customer lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#customer-lifecycle) and [lead and contact statuses](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#lead-and-contact-statuses) for criteria for _when_ we can reach out to organizations.
