## Welcome to the Corporate Marketing Handbook
{:.no_toc}

The Corporate Marketing team includes Corporate Events, Corporate Communications (PR, Executive Communications and Social Media), All-Remote Marketing, and the Community Team. Corporate Marketing is ultimately responsible for creating awareness and driving top-of-funnel interest in GitLab. We do this by driving conversations in the communications channels that accelerate our objectives and by developing an integrated communication strategy that is executed globally.

## How We Work

### Project Management

There is an initiative underway to simplify Project Management across all of Marketing.

In the meantime, we have implemented a few practices to help us get organized:

- Add weekly milestones to issues based on the week you expect to work on the issue (format is `Fri: Apr 17, 2020`)
- Move issues forward into future milestones, or place them in the `backlog` milestone if they're no longer planned
- We close out the week's milestone each week, and issues will be moved forward if they are not closed out
- You can use labels however you like, they are a tool for you and your team to filter/sort issues

### OKRs

Each quarter, we create cascading OKRs from:

- [CEO OKRs](/company/okrs/#most-recent-okrs)
- [Marketing OKRs](/handbook/marketing/#most-recent-okrs)

#### Most recent OKRs

  * [FY22 Q4](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/-/epics/160)
  * [FY22 Q3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/-/epics/136)
  * [FY22 Q2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/-/epics/92)
  * [Previous OKRs](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#okr-archive)

## GitLab brand

GitLab empowers everyone through knowledge access, job access, and the DevOps platform. This is captured in our [GitLab brand](/company/purpose/).

## Brand personality

GitLab's brand has a personality that is reflected in everything we do. It doesn't matter if we are hosting a fancy dinner with fortune 500 CIOs, at a hackathon, or telling our story on about.gitlab.com...across all our communication methods, and all our audiences, GitLab has a personality that shows up in how we communicate.

Our personality is built around four main characteristics.

1. **Human**: We [write like we talk](/handbook/values/#directness). We avoid buzzwords and jargon, and instead communicate simply, clearly, and sincerely. We treat people with kindness.
1. **Competent**: We are [highly accomplished](/handbook/values/#results), and we communicate with conviction. We are [efficient](/handbook/values/#efficiency) at everything we do.
1. **Quirky**: We embrace [diversity of opinion](/handbook/values/#diversity-inclusion). We embrace new ideas based on their merit, even if they defy commonly held norms.
1. **Humble**: We care about helping those around us [achieve great things](/handbook/values/#customer-results) more than we care about our personal accomplishments.

These four characteristics work together to form a personality that is authentic to GitLab team-members, community, and relatable to our audience. If we were `quirky` without being `human` we could come across as eccentric. If we were `competent` without being `humble` we could come across as arrogant.

GitLab has a [higher purpose](/company/mission/#mission) to make it so that **everyone can contribute**. We want to inspire a sense of adventure in those around us so that they join us in contributing to making that mission a reality.

## Sponsored Events - Staffing Process

**Sponsored Event Tiers**

Sponsored Events are categorized into (3) Tiers at GitLab.  The Tier of the show is determined by the sponsorship level, thought leadership opportunities, size of the booth, stakeholders attending and if the audience is our key demographic.  Depending on the booths size they are staffed accordingly: 



    1. Tier 1: Typically uses our 20 x 20 Tier 1 booth structure, which has (4) demo stations, lightning talk area, meeting area, host counter, activation (example: VR experience), & coding challenge desk. Ideally 20-30 staff members will be asked to work at the booth in order to adequately staff all the shifts and ensure coverage in all the zones. 
    For Tier 1 shows, we may add-on an additional Activation Zone space that will feature other activities. Some examples GitLab has done in that past include: a caricature artist, code challenge, charging stations, or tabletop games. 
    2. Tier 2: Will either be a smaller version of our Tier 1 booth or a turnkey booth 10 x 10 - 10 x 20 foot print. Around 6 - 10 staff members will be requested to staff the demo stations, activation, host counter & assist with other onsite activities such as sessions, photography or an ancillary event.
    3. Tier 3: This size sponsorship does not require a big lift from Corporate Events and only 4-6 staff members will be needed onsite to manage two shifts that are properly staffed and can handle 1 or 2 demo stations and a host counter. These shows have no other activities going on such as sessions, meetings or an ancillary event. 

**Staff Process**



1. **Create the [Staffing Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Event_Travel_Staffing_Template) when the epic is created with the show overview & GitLab policy to attend with checklist for staff members to complete & get manager approval. ** 
2. Consider the audience of the show as well as the show theme/focus before reaching out to departments to ask for staffing help. 
    1. Example: if it’s a Security focused show like Black Hat, maybe a Security team member from Product or a TMM with Security expertise should attend. 

2. Once you have taken into consideration the audience and focus of the show, you can start reaching out to managers and VPs via group slack channels to staff the show. Try to be specific in your request with travel dates,details of the show, and how many team members from the group that you're needing. 



    2. Example: we’re looking for 2 TMMs to help with Security demos at Black Hat in Las Vegas on August 10-11. Can you see who is available on your team? 

3. Once you have built a list, start tagging in the team members to complete the staff checklist in the comments and ask them to tag in their manager for approval. 

4. Once the team member completes their checklist, slack DM them their registration code to register for the show with additional information for booking hotels and flights.

5. After you have a full staff list and all those who are expected to attend fully registered, you can start building out the staff schedule to assign booth shifts. Booth shifts typically last 4 hours and are split between AM and PM shifts. 

6. Once the staff list is full, make sure to send out invites for: 



    3. Kick Off call (ideally 6-8 weeks out) 
    4. Recurring staff sync meetings every other week for show updates & weekly once 4 weeks out for Tier 1 & 2 shows
    5. Know Before You Go (KBYG) 2-3 business days prior to travel 

7. Once the staff schedule is finalized, send out calendar invites to the actual booth shifts about 1 week before day 1 of the show.

## Swag/ [Merchandise Handling](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/)

See more details on handling and fulfillment specific on the [merchandise handling page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/).
All swag requests, creation and vendor selection is handled by the Brand Strategy team.

- Our goal is that 95% of swag is sustainable or eco-friendly
- We aim to have our swag delight and/or be useful. We want to create swag that is versatile, easy to store and transport.
- As a remote company with team members in over 67 countries - our swag often has to go on miraculous journeys.
- With this in mind we try to ship things that are durable, light and that will unlikely get stuck in customs.
- We strive to make small batch, limited edition and themed swag for the community to collect.
- Our goal is to make swag self-serve => [web shop](https://gitlab.myshopify.com/). Please note our swag store is not intended for ordering and expensing back items purchased, see the [swag handbook](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/) to order swag if you are internal to GitLab.

## Swag Ordering Process
GitLab utilizes, [Boundless](https://www.boundlesscollection.com/) and their warehouse as our [swag vendor of choice](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/merchandise-handling/#requesting-swag). Boundless is available to produce, ship and store swag and event material for global events. The Event DRI is responsible for all swag and trade show items for their events. Since the Corporate Events team is responsible for both Owned and Sponsored Events swag, both processes are detailed below.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sponsored Events: </span>**



1. Go into the Boundless Corp Events Portal and see the swag items and quantities that we have pre-ordered for the year.
2. Based on the estimated number of attendees at the show, order enough swag to cover at least 25% of attendees. 
3. You are required to provide an Allocadia ID for all swag orders. All charges related to swag and shipping will be associated with your specific campaign. Please see [this page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/#how-marketing-tracks-campaign-expenses) for more Allocadia ID information.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Budgeting for Swag: </span>**



4. **Shipping:** Shipping costs will always need to be accounted for in your overall campaign swag budget. Please make sure to specify all shipping addresses for advance warehouse and post-deadline addresses and deadlines when ordering your items. We typically ask the show management agency we're working with to provide return shipping labels with each order for easy return shipping to the warehouse after the event.
5. **Existing Items:** Item quantities are listed in the portal. Please select from the current items in stock for your event. If you need a larger quantity of an item over what is available, please reach out to our contact at Boundless for reordering.
6. **New Items and Designs:** New Swag Items & Swag Designs require management budget approval and design approval by the brand team for brand consistency. For new swag design requests, please review the [Brand and Design page here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#brand--marketing-design-issue-templates)and open the appropriate issue template for your request.
7. **Lead Times:** Please be aware that ordering newly designed swag or placing reorders for existing items requires adequate lead time. Timeframes vary greatly based on the items selected and design approval. General Lead Times: 6 weeks to produce a new item and 2-3 weeks to reorder current designs.
8. **Stickers:** For sticker orders, please utilize our [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/) account. You can log into StickerMule through the marketing vault within 1Password. Delivery options and timelines are provided during the ordering process. Any new sticker designs must be approved by the brand team for brand consistency. For new sticker design requests, please review the [Brand and Design page here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#brand--marketing-design-issue-templates)and open the appropriate issue template for your request. General sticker order lead time: 2 weeks, but if you want to send to the advance warehouse plan for 4 weeks.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Owned Events: </span>**



1. Think about how many attendees there will be. 
2. Consider the messaging/theme of the event. If it's a more technical audience, then consider ordering swag geared towards the tech crowd. If it's more executive/C-level focused event, then consider higher end swag kits. 
3. Consider the different tiers of swag and price points. For certain owned events, there could be multiple tiers. For example:
* Attendees ($50 per kit)
* Speakers ($100+ per kit)
* VIP/Large Customers ($4-500 per kit)
* Internal GitLab team members ($100 per kit)
4. Use the price per person or intended functionality as a work back point for how many items, quality of items, etc. that need to be ordered. 
* For example $100 pp for attendees, you could get 5-6 smaller items like notebooks, pens, water bottles, t-shirt, hat, socks, etc. or one high level backpack
* For example of intended functionality/theme of the event, if we’re hosting an event on a boat then we’ll give out custom captain hats and ponchos vs a myriad of branded small items.
5. Once there is a swag plan in place along with necessary information such as quantity per item and budget, send an email to Boundless to ask about availability and pricing as well as the most eco-friendly option possible. 
6. Once items have been agreed upon, if we are choosing to do custom Event branding on swag for events such as Commit or Contribute, please review the [Brand and Design page here ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#brand--marketing-design-issue-templates) and open the appropriate issue template for your request. Ensure you have the swag design specs included in the description section before assigning it to Brand to work on a custom design.
    1. It's best to plan ahead to ensure proper lead times for requested assets needed based on Design’s bandwidth
7. Obtain contract/invoice and submit through Coupa, provide Boundless with PO
    2. Plan for shipping/freight, warehouse/handling fees & tax costs
8. Send the design over to Boundless who will produce a proof. Proof will go through review with Brand through the design issue and Corp Events before ordering. 
    3. Make sure the designs and proofs are also saved in the shared Drive folder for that event. 
9. Once the order is placed and the produced swag has shipped out to the venue, ensure all tracking numbers are stored in a spreadsheet to verify all packages have been received. 
10. Note: If doing an individual drop ship (vs bulk on site) allocate budget/design resources for an accompanying branded note and or sticker
    4. Depending on the value of the item we do not provide tracking (ie. general shirt swag from a virtual event vs. a high level speaker gift if needed)
    5. If this is a drop ship, make sure to plan comms with general timelines, disclaimers for shipping delays, and a contact email for questions
11. **See above for lead times, shipping guidelines, and sticker ordering. They are the same as Sponsored Events.**

## Post-Event Process 

### Lead upload

1. Within 24 hours of an event finishing, you should either receive the leads from the lead scanner company or download all registrants from the registration database (Eventbrite, CVent, etc). 
2. Once leads are received by event DRI, Corp Events Coordinator cleans lead list from show using [this list import process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/)
3. MOps gets tagged into Cleaned Lead List and uploads to Marketo program, which syncs into SFDC in 15 min to 2 hours usually
4. MOps uploads lead into Marketo program, alerts Event Manager, and closes issue 
5. Event Manager then watches the SFDC campaign for lead assignment and follow up 
6. Add a calendar reminder to check the SFDC campaign 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-show to see the lead conversion rates. 

### Create Recap/Results Deck

The purpose of the recap/results deck is to give leadership a quick overview of the show in 3-5 slides. The deck should include event highlights, results, budget updates, and shout outs. Additionally, this deck will be a living document that the Event Manager should update as leads are followed up on and converted. Most recap/results decks should be completed roughly 2 weeks post-show and no later than 1 month post-show.

Example Decks:

Tier 1: [2022 KubeCon EU](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eR_GXpH9koGV7stgvMpsOBWivc0z3CjnSslgYZPsA5Y/edit?usp=sharing)
