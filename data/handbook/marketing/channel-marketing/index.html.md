## Our Team
Global Channel and Alliances Marketing is a team of seasoned professionals supporting global channel and alliances sales objectives and providing support to the GitLab channel partner community and customers.  This small but mighty team is responsible for the development of channel and alliances marketing campaigns that leverage GitLab’s Go to Market Campaigns and value plays.  We work with partners to help them understand what the campaigns are, how to use them to help drive partner sourced opportunities, how to leverage upcoming GitLab webinars/webcasts to drive conversion and how to generate trials for GitLab that they can nurture with prospects.  Channel partners are ultimately responsible for the execution of these campaigns.  

The Global Channel marketing team provides support to partners by creating different campaign assets into leverageable go-to-market programs called Instant Campaigns that partners can easily pick up and run with their customer or prospect lists.  GitLab channel marketing is also responsible for the development, rollout and management of trial enablement programs by which partners can generate trials of GitLab directly from their website, and passing or providing trial leads generated from GitLab’s own website to be worked and converted by partners.  

Channel marketing also enables channel go to market efforts through MDF funding and management, by identifying upcoming field marketing events and activities that channel partners can participate in, and by identifying opportunities for channel partners to participate with Alliances partners and GitLab on joint go to market activities.

We partner with regional Channel Account Managers and Field Marketing regional teams to work closely with channel partners and GitLab Alliances for inclusion in their regional marketing plans.  

As a service bureau to a wide variety of teams, we have support functions that are both in and out of scope at this time.  We have ideated on a list of potential future service capabilities that, as this team is able to add resources and our business plan requires it, we will add to our list of service offerings.  To recommend that we add a service offering to this growing list of potential offerings, please create an issue.

## Quarterly Planning: Field and Channel

As GitLab evolves, the growth of the channel becomes a critical component to our overall strategy of growth and new logo capture.  With established teams in place, it's time to take our engagement up a level and as such, review how we partner together for proactive, and efficient engagement that results in high quality demand generation plans and delivering actionable leads for our sales teams.
In order for our collective plans to work, it's first important to verbalize the roles, responsibilities and focus areas for each functional team.

13 weeks prior to the start of the following quarter, planning for that quarter will commence.  FMM's and CAM's are expected to partner together and setup regular, consistent planning calls, preferrably bi-weekly. The focus of each cadence call will change as the plan formulates.  Specifically: 
*   ### Weeks 1-2 (11-13 weeks prior to the future quarter start):
Develop partner campaign objectives and set goals (specifically NFO SAO goals).  Set up recurring biweekly cadence with the individual partner, CAM and FMM to keep planning and campaign action items on track.
*   ### Weeks 3 and 4 (9-11 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Based on campaign goals, identify the regions where pipeline needs are the greatest.  Architect campaigns to support that/those regions.  What are the campaign elements/tactics needed to create interest?
*   ### Week 5 and 6 (7-9 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Agree to campaign tactics and persona targets, develop budget request and expected outcomes in the form of MQL's and SAO's.
*   ### Week 7 and 8 (5-7 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
Formalize/finalize the tactics, define action items and workback plan.  Identify any speaker needs.  Final agreement on MQL and SAO targets.  Complete FY23 Partner Planning Template and submit back to FMM and CAM.
*   ### Week 9 (4 weeks prior to future quarter start): 
FMM and CAM submit holistic budget request to Channel Marketing for MDF approval.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
*   ## Channel Account Managers 
Own the strategy, relationship and ongoing, consistent engagement with the Select partners in their territory.  The channel account manager is responsible for the holistic success and health of the partner relationship. 

*   ## GEO Channel Director
 Sets the strategy for the region, manages the Channel Account Managers and approves the criteria for Select and Open partner selection in the region.
*   ## Field Marketing Managers
In partnership with field sales, drive MQL's to convert to SAO's.  The field marketing managers are responsible for articulating which areas of the business require the most attention and where we need channel partner engagement to drive demand generation plans.
*   ## GEO Field Marketing Director
Develops the strategy and conversion targets for the team in partnership with field sales leadership.
*   ## Global Channel Marketing Director
Develops scalable demand generation campaigns and tactics for partners to generate Partner Sourced opportunities.
*   ## Channel Marketing Manager
Responsible for supporting CAMS in specific geographies, by creating demand generation marketing plans with Focus Partners. In charge of planning MDF activites and improving Partner's participating in various Channel programs.

Once a plan for the quarter has been established it is imperative that the channel account manager and the field marketing manager stay in close, consistent alignment about plan execution.  The strategy is driven by the channel account manager, while the field marketing manager is responsible for executing on that strategy in partnership with various support teams, including but not limited to the channel account managers.

[MDF](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/analyst-relations/channel-marketing/#requesting-mdf-funds)

## Tracking Success:
GitLab Marketing receives 'credit' for opportunities that are partner sourced so long as the oportunity has a BATP (Bizable Touchpoint) from the campaign.

## Partner-Initiated GitLab Free Trial Lead Gen Program

Partners now have the ability to place a FREE trial button on their website as a critical call to action to their demand generation plans. Free trials allow users to have 30 day access to the full set of features in the Self-Managed version of GitLab. Once a visitor requests a free trial from a GitLab partner, the record is sent to GitLab for the license key to be generated and assigned to a partner in SFDC. In addition, the lead is then routed automatically via Vartopia to the partner for tracking and follow up. This is the same process that is followed whether the record is considered a lead or a contact within GitLab's instance of SFDC.

Partners can access and manage their GitLab leads in the same interface as their [deal registration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/#the-deal-registration-program-overview). When leads are shared with partners, partners will now see an additional tab in the Vartopia GitLab Deal Registration portal called Prospects. Partners can also easily convert their prospects to deal registrations and submit them to GitLab for approval. Please refer to the following assets to walk you through how to access these leads, step by step: 

*   [Reference the User Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IYOPfvwIWgUIknF4JZdTM4BIO-lmm0U2/view?usp=sharing) 
*   [How-to video](https://youtu.be/e3qXq6TGbMY)

## Beyond our Team’s Scope

*   Individual partner support, planning, ideation and execution including but not limited to joint demand generation campaigns.  Please work closely with your region’s [field marketing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing--channel-marketing) team and reference linked Handbook pages for self support and field support of these programs.
*   Custom campaigns: Channel Marketing does not currently have the resources to support individual partner campaigns and events. Please encourage your partners to leverage one of our turnkey, and integrated [Instant Marketing Campaigns](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/instant-campaigns/) available on the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/).  For unique virtual and live events, the CAM should engage with their [field marketing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#field-marketing--channel-marketing) counterpart to leverage field budget and marketing support for joint events.  The Field Marketing Manager will engage with their sales teams and support the CAM and partner with development, execution, and lead follow up for  the event.
*   Unique Partner Asset Creation: Channel Marketing is unable to work directly with partners to customize their marketing assets. 
*   Joint demand generation planning and execution: **The GitLab CAM is the primary point of contact to enable their partners run a successful campaign or event.**  
*   Event speakers: The Channel Marketing team does not have the resources to help locate GitLab speakers for partner events.
*   Partner Blogs: The Channel Marketing team does not have the resources to craft unique content to support a partner blog or content request.
*   Press releases: The Channel Marketing team does not have the responsibility to edit and approve partner press releases.  Please create a [Channel or Tech Partner Announcement issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=channel-partner-announcement-request) for coordination with the Corporate Communications/PR team
*   Sponsored social media posts: partners looking to GitLab to promote partner activities would not route those requests through Channel Marketing.  Instead, CAM’s obtain the partner’s social media channels and [create an issue](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/#open-a-new-issue-to-request-social-coverage) for the Social Media team.  This request should include the partner’s social media information, detailed description of what we are being asked to promote and target dates.  
*   Event attendance: The Channel Marketing team does not own a database of contacts by which to drive attendance to partner specific events nor do we possess the resources to support such requests.
*   Partner training:**<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> [Partner training](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/training/)</span>** is managed and supported by the [Channel Partner Training, Certifications, and Enablement team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/training/).
*   Partner portal management: [Partner portal administration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/channel/channel-programs-ops/#partner-portal-administration) is managed by GitLab Channel Program Operations.

   * Enablement is a sales and/or technical motion and the marketing manager can review or include the training as part of a larger initiative (and should) but would not be the one to author the content.  Alliances marketing manager can also lean on our enablement team to help provide resources/assistance.
