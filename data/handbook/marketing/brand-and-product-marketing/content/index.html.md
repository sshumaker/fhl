{: .no_toc}

We create, review, and improve content to establish GitLab as the leader in modern software development and DevOps, while also sharing the company‚Äôs vision for the future. We create content that maintains and improves our search rankings around key terms. We create content for go-to-market campaigns that drive awareness, growth, engagement, and conversion.

### Adding an event to the editorial calendar

1. Make sure there is an associated issue for the event. Link the issue in the event description.
1. Check "all day event" unless there is a specific time the piece should publish. This is rare and usually only if a blog post is tied to a time-sensitive PR announcement.
1. Homepage hero content is a multi-day/week long event. Make sure it is listed on the calendar for the entirety of it's promotional period.
1. Name your event using the following nomenclature: <emoji, title of content, campaign>. Example: `üìù 5 Reasons to Use GitLab, Just Commit`

## Content Strategy

Embrace a media company mindset to develop a content strategy that organically attracts and retains our target audience over the use of traditional disruption tactics with the goal of increasing website traffic and preference for our content resources. Our global content strategy prioritizes the needs and preferences of our audiences over selling GitLab in order to build trust and increase audience retention. We aim to create enjoyable content experiences that people seek out.

We accomplish this through:

1. Rigorous research and understanding of our audience needs, behaviors, and lived experiences.
1. A single content hub that is easy to find, search, and interact with.
1. Consistency in quality and format. Our audience knows what to expect.
1. A mix of journalistic and entertainment style content.
1. Exceptional communication standards. We prioritize a clear and direct tone of voice over cutsy, convoluted language.

### Content Strategy Principles

1. **Audience-first mindset.** All content is produced with the audience in mind and has a clearly defined "who, what, why, how".
1. **Entertain and connect.** Our content is entertaining, enjoyable to consume, and expresses our acute understanding of our audience. We want our content to compel our audience to binge and share versus bookmark for later.
1. **Make it easy.** Relevant content is easy to find regardless of format. Our content finds our audiences where they are.
1. **Media company mindset.** Our global content team operates with the mindset that our audience is our customers, content is our product, and subscribers are our currency.

## Content Distribution

All content should have a distribution strategy. It's generally better to have fewer pieces of content with solid distribution plans, rather than more content with lackluster distribution plans. Before a piece of content moves into production, consider the below.

**When, how, and where will this content be distributed beyond its initial home?** Content DRIs are expected to build a plan for each piece of content for where it will be distributed. Potential answers to this include: 
1. [PathFactory](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/) tracks shared by Campaign Managers (`#marketing-campaigns` Slack channel)
1. Social media (see below)
1. In the news media/press (see below)
1. Within communities such as Reddit, Hacker News, etc.
1. On your personal social media accounts
1. On podcasts
1. On webinars
1. And beyond!

### Building a distribution plan

The **[Content in Campaigns Handbook Page](/handbook/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/content-in-campaigns/)** has a detailed process to enable distribution across all marketing channels (email, paid digital, social, etc.). Please be sure that the Marketing Campaigns team is aware of all new content being created, so that they can follow the epic/issue creation process far in advance of content being delivered.

Aim for [a boring solution](/handbook/values/#boring-solutions). 

1. Create an issue in the Corporate Marketing project to request consideration from our Corporate Communications (and PR agency partners). Create this issue as soon as you aware that an asset will exist, even if it's months in advance. This provides maximum runway for our communication partners to plan and amplify your content. Even if you're unsure if an asset is pitchable, create the issue and share in the `#external-comms` Slack channel. It is better to be told that an asset does not fit into a communications plan than to not share. 

   - [This is an example of a PR/comms request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/5533) (*only accessible to GitLab team members*). It achieves three core things.

      - Provides context on the content/asset
      - Provides an expected launch date
      - Provides a clear ask and starts a conversation to determine if the asset is pitchable and/or fits into upcoming PR plans and pitch strategies

2. Create an issue in the Corporate Marketing project to request consideration from our Social Marketing team. Follow the [step-by-step guide](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/) in the team's handbook. [This is an example of a social marketing request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/6051) (*only accessible to GitLab team members*). Even if you're unsure if an asset is suitable for social media, create the issue and share in the `#social_media_action` Slack channel. It is better to be told that an asset does not fit into a social media plan than to not share. 

Distribution inspiration can be found from [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/TheCoolestCool/status/1228010347690385410) from Ross Simmonds of Foundation. 

   * This can include Twitter threads, LinkedIn shares, Instagram stories, and [team member social media advocacy/enablement](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/team-member-social-advocacy/).
   * Document forums and communities where this content will be shared, and from whom.
   * Document newsletters and events where this content may be submitted for syndication and resharing. 

## Teams

### Blog

The Editorial team's [goals are to grow our blog audience, engage readers, and covert readers into subscribers](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/content/editorial-team/#goal-grow-our-audience-engage-readers-and-convert-readers-into-subscribers). To achieve this our strategy is guided by our existing audience's needs and wants; prioritizing useful, educational, informative, and entertaining content that has value beyond promoting GitLab.

Areas of focus:

- Continue to monitor traffic to posts and document takeaways on performance to inform our planning of future posts
- Continue to document [best practices](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/content/editorial-team/#writing-blog-posts--best-practices) to enable contributors
- Improve SEO in new blog posts and selected past posts
- Experiment with curated content ("collections" of new and existing content on specific themes)
- Experiment with editorial-first content (i.e. a journalistic approach to stories and covering industry trends or news that is relevant to our audience, but may not place GitLab front and center)
- Collaborate with Digital Experience on [blog redesign work](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/158)

### Content Marketing

The content market team creates, writes, and publishes awareness and consideration level content for the website. The content focuses primarily on topics pages, web articles, eBooks, infographics, case studies, and white papers. The team works closely with various groups to strategize and develop content for all integrated marketing campaigns, including creating assets and providing awareness level insights for email marketing.

Areas of focus:

- Continue to create content for existing campaigns: VC&C, CI/CD, DevSecOps, GitOps.
- Continue cross-team collaboration for partner campaigns.
- Continue to produce case studies, web articles, and topics pages.
- Work with content gap analysis to continue to create content accordingly.
- Create topics pages and web articles to coincide with product marketing use cases.

### Search Marketing

The Search Marketing team focuses on helping grow revenue for GitLab by increasing traffic to GitLab public websites and improving conversion paths for visitors to become MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads). More detail is within the [Search Marketing handbook](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/search-marketing/).

## Homepage Promotion Guidelines

The homepage hero is updated frequently to promote new content, events, and announcements. To use the homepage hero for promotion, follow the guidelines below. **Please submit your request as early as possible to get on the content calendar.**

1. [Open a homepage promotion request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-website-homepage-promotion) **as early as possible.** If there is another promotion already scheduled, we may not be able to accommodate your request.
1. Fill out the request completely. Provide as much information as possible for the copywriter.
1. Suggested promotion period should not exceed two weeks. If you are promoting an event that is happening months into the future, we can promote the event more than once. Suggest a few 2-week periods for promotion. For example, if your event is happening in September and registration opens in June, you may want to promote your event for two weeks following initial promotion, and for two weeks leading up to the event.

## Writing copy for the homepage hero

1. The H1 should be 50 characters or less and include a "you" statement, speaking directly to the reader.
1. The H2 should be 65 characters or less and include a value statement (i.e. what the reader will gain).
1. CTAs should be lead with an action verb and convey exactly what will be given in exchange for filling out the form.

## Requesting content team support

_Need help finding relevant content to use in an email or to send to a customer?_ Ask for help in the #content channel.*

### Requesting content and copy reviews

1. Use the [editing request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/global-content/content-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=editing-request).

## Content production

The content team supports many cross-functional marketing initiatives. We aim for content production to be a month ahead of planned events and campaigns so that content is readily available for use. In accordance with our values of [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we publish our proposed content plans at the beginning of each quarter. We don't hoard content for one big launch and instead plan sets of content to execute on each quarter and published each piece of content as it's completed.

Content production is determined and prioritized based on the following:

1. SEO recommendations
1. Integrated campaigns
1. Corporate marketing events
1. Newsworthiness
1. Brand awareness opportunity

We align our content production to pillars and topics to ensure we're creating a cohesive set of content for our audience to consume. Pillar content is multi-purpose and can be plugged into integrated campaigns, event campaigns, and sales plays.

### Content alignment

Content production is aligned to digital campaigns and product messaging.

**Definitions**

- Campaign/Value driver: A high-level GTM message that doesn't change often. Campaigns are tracked as `Parent Epics`.
- Pillar: A story within a theme. Pillars are tracked as `Child Epics`.
- Set: A topical grouping of content to be executed within a specific timeframe. Sets are tracked as `Milestones`.
- Resource: An informative asset, such as an eBook or report, that is often gated.

## Content stage / buyer's journey definitions

### Awareness (Top)

Users and buyers realize that they have a problem or challenge which could be solved through some sort of outside software or service. At this stage, they are trying to define the scope and the relative impact and size of the problem. They probably do not yet have a solution identified, but are in the process of learning about potential solutions to their specific business problem.

In general, messaging in collateral and content should be focused on **educating them about the problems they are facing, the business impact of their problems, and the reality that others are successfully solving the same problem**. This is an opportunity for them to learn that GitLab is an authority in addressing their domains.

### Consideration (Middle)

Users and buyers understand the problem they are trying to solve and the business impact/value of addressing the problem and are now actively seeking and evaluating potential remedies to their business issue. Typically, they will be considering a range of approaches from better leveraging existing tools to investing in new technologies and vendors. In this stage they are focused on identifying options that meet their specific requirements and needs. While cost will be a consideration, they have not yet made a final decision about how to address their needs. In this stage, they will be defining their budget and overall plans for implementing a solution.

In general, collateral and content designed to reach prospects in this stage of their journey should be focused on **positioning GitLab as a viable and compelling solution to their specific problem**.

### Decision/Purchase (Bottom)

Users and buyers have concluded that they need to invest in solving a specific business problem and are now comparing and evaluating specific options. In this stage, they are evaluating and comparing different options in order to identify the ideal solution for their specific situation. They will consider Fit (technology, process, etc), implementation effort/cost, total cost of ownership and other factors to guide them in making a final selection.

In general, collateral and content designed to reach prospects in this stage of their journey should be focused on key information that a buyer needs to **justify GitLab as their chosen solution**.

## Content library

Content is stored in [PathFactory](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/). To request access to PathFactory, submit an access request form.

The content library in PathFactory can be filtered by content type, funnel stage, and topic. Topics are listed and defined in the [marketing operations](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/pathfactory/).

Published content should be shared to the `#content-updates` channel and added to PathFactory with the appropriate tags.
