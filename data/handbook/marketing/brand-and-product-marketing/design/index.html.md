# <i class="fas fa-bullhorn fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i> Welcome to the GitLab Brand Design Handbook

{: .no_toc}

We develop our brand visual identity design to ensure it stays relevant in the market and reflects the benefits and quality of our product. We are the creative partners for GitLab marketing. We create, conceptualize, and design high quality brand experiences. 

## Overview

### Purpose

*Why we exist*

As stewards of the [GitLab brand](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/brand-activation/brand-standards/), our goal is to educate and enable the wider organization with resources to effetively and honestly communicate what the company does to our internal and external audiences.

### Vision

*Where we're going*

The GitLab Brand Design team will elevate the brand beyond the logo and visuals - positioning ourselves as experts in brand strategy and behavior (how the brand presents itself, how it's precieved, and what makes it authentic)

### Mission

*What we do*

Create simple, effective, and intentional brand experiences by solving complex problems; defining the what, why, and how, resulting in a message that's easy to understand.

#### Contacting the team

The best way to get in contact with the Brand design team is to fill out one of the above issue templates with your request, or to:
- Use the @gl-design tag in GitLab issues and epics for visibility
- @-mention individuals from the team in GitLab issues and epics
- Ask your question in the #marketing-design Slack channel

#### Partnership with third parties

In certain cases, the help of a third party agency or design partner may be brought in for a project. The following serves as criteria for when to outsource design:

- Smaller-scale projects, such as stickers or requests that do not meet our current business prioritization, where the brand guidelines provide sufficient creative direction and parameters for the third party to work with.
- Larger-scale projects where the Brand and Digital team need additional support given the timeline and/or scale of the request.

Whenever a third party is brought in to support design, the work must be shared with the Brand Design team to ensure brand integrity and that we are [working transparently](/handbook/values/#transparency) with one another.

#### Team logo requests

In the past we have accomodated internal team logo requests, typically in the form of customized tanukis. As our company grows, this approach is not scalable for the Brand Design team. Additionally, altering the logo or using too many logos diminishes the integrity of our brand identity and dilutes our brand awareness. We understand the desire for teams within GitLab to have their own identity, but this should not be prioritized over the business value that comes from preserving our core branding. For this reason, all designs should complement and adhere to our brand guidelines. 

If your team works on a larger initiative, please refer to our [program lockup guidelines](https://design.gitlab.com/brand-logo/branded-lockups#program-lockups). These lockups should be used in conjunction with the GitLab logo and branding. If you are unsure if your program or initiative requires a lockup, please [contact the Brand Design team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#contacting-the-team).

## How we work

### Team structure

We are all brand designers, brand champions, critically thinking problem solvers, strategists, and teammates – leveraging each others' strengths while growing our collective knowledge and expertise. We work by following GitLab’s [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) and using issues and epics to track our work. 

#### Responsibilities

- **Be lean and efficient:** leverage everyone’s strengths and expertise and trust one another to make the best decisions for the team and our brand.
- **Wear many hats:** have the flexibility to tackle a variety of tasks demanded by the role - all for the greater good of the team and company.
- **Develop creative concepts:** drive the creative direction of your individual projects. For large-scale projects, Adam and Luke are responsible for core concept development, which is then presented to the wider team for discussion, feedback, and refinement.
- **Carry out the creative:** bring a creative direction to life with touch-point collateral informed by the creative direction, all while [managing your time accordingly](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one).
- **Advocate for the GitLab Brand:** know, contribute to, and uphold our [brand standards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/brand/brand-activation/brand-standards/), and review materials from within and outside our team to preserve our brand’s integrity.
- **Know the tools:** be proficient in the Adobe Suite and Figma (for designing), Mural and 
FigJam (for brainstorming), Canva (for creating self-service assets), and the Google Suite 
(for company-wide materials). 

#### Design approvals
The team should feel empowered to make the best decisions possible for the GitLab brand while seeking structured and direct feedback from the team as often as possible. Adam and Luke are here to make final decisions as needed, but do not need to be the bottleneck of progress.

### Team workflow 

- **Team check-ins:** We have three recurring team syncs: (1) Monday [design hours](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOxh6UPZ7n0oGUdxc1p4CggCXbz-uLzQN8DL-_AUEMg/edit?usp=sharing) call where we catch up and talk about work for the upcoming week. (2) Tuesday async GeekBot status reports in the `#marketing-design` slack channel. (3) Wednesday design hours call where we get feedback and collaborate on topics that need to be addressed.
- **Working in issues:** All design requests should use our [issue templates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/#requesting-support) and include the `mktg-status::triage`, `corporate-marketing`, and `design` issue labels to show up on our [team’s triage board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/2233942?label_name%5B%5D=Corporate%20Marketing&label_name%5B%5D=design&label_name%5B%5D=mktg-status%3A%3Atriage). Adam and Luke triage work at the beginning of the week, and team members are able to assign work to themselves, too. We use issue [weights](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/issue_weight.html) (1 weight = approx. 4 hours of work) to measure bandwidth and [milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/) to track capacity for each week. Everyone can see their work for the week by looking at their individual [issue board](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html).
- **Collaborating together:** We work together as a team by playing to each of our strengths. Work is usually triaged out to team members whose design skills fit the request, or we collaborate together on a project using our combined talents.
- **Small projects:** Smaller projects are typically assigned to one designer and completed within 2 weeks. Given the quick turnaround at GitLab, we work in small iterations, referred to as the MVC ([minimum viable change](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc)) approach.
- **Medium and large projects:** For larger projects, we assess the request and then propose a timeline. For campaigns or projects with a unique concept, we kick off a brainstorming session either async or on a cross-functional call with the larger team, or whoever has been assigned, and then we pitch the concept(s) to the stakeholders.
- **Sharing work:** Work should be shared early and often, either in our design hours calls or async in our private `#brand-design-team` slack channel. Drafts are typically shared async with the stakeholder using the [design tab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html) in issues or as a screenshot in comments.

#### Saving work

We upload and pull work locally from the [corporate-marketing repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design). For confidential projects, we store files in the team [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0AFNq7VkzIz5WUk9PVA).

- The [highest folder level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design) is organized by project type (ie: publications, campaigns, events, etc.). From there, they are broken down by category (ebook, whitepaper, campaign name, event year, etc.) Once you are in the relevant folder, create a new folder with your project’s name. 
- Creative explorations or work-in-progress files can be stored in your respective [progress folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design/_progress), but make sure that final files are stored in a relevant project folder.
- Each project folder should have at least two sub-folders: a folder for your source files (`_artwork`) and another folder for your exported files (ie: png, exports, pdf, etc.). 
- File names should be lowercase and use hyphens in place of spaces. Include the file dimensions in the file name. [Avoid acronyms](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines).
- Both the Google Drive and repository save version history; for that reason, files can be saved over as edits to the file are made.

#### Using git and terminal

- [Push and pull](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#pull-and-push) work frequently, at least once a day, to keep our work up-to-date. If you are working on a file that others may be in as well, communicate it with the team so that no one saves over someone else’s work.
- To get started, [set up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u7iNFnbD4Nj4aeLRFpmnzHewgKBjCwdyjvTuOND0rfA/edit?usp=sharing) a local clone of the `corporate-marketing` repository to your machine. For your day-to-day work, here are the typical git commands for pulling and pushing work, in the order of which they should be used: 
    - `cd corporate-marketing` - this command only needs to be used once upon opening the [Terminal app](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac). The `cd` command may need to be done multiple times, followed by the parent folder name where you’ve stored the repository on your device, until you get into the `corporate-marketing` folder
    - `git pull` - this updates your local repository to mirror any changes made by the rest of the team; do this command before starting work or pushing any new work
    - `git status` - optional command; this provides a summary of all the changes you’ve made locally that need to be pushed back the repository
    - `git checkout [`insert file path`]` - optional commnand; this can be used to remove any files you do not want to push to repository
    - `git add .` - use this command before pushing your work; it will add all the files you have made changes to
    - `git commit -m “`[insert description of changes]`”` - include a message with a summary of your changes; this is viewable to everyone and provides context
    - `git push origin master` - this will push all your changes back to the repository, including the commit message to describe the changes
    - `git pull --rebase`, followed by, `git push origin master` - use these two commands to reset if you receive an error when pushing

#### Ebooks, whitepapers, and one-pagers

- Design templates for each publication are located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/tree/master/design/_resources/_designer-resources/templates).
- Our publications are often sent to Smartling for translation; save out a .zip file of the packaged artwork for easy download.
- Most one-pagers can be self-serviced using one of our [Google Doc templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U97a05txXI29pGxjOtLiG4DW-zBMHAU5?usp=sharing).

#### Digital ads

- Digital ads often need to be customized after creation, and for that reason we encourage Canva for easier self-service. Some ads need to be edited by Demandbase under certain specs and [file requirements](https://support.demandbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027082151-Ad-Banner-Specifications#h_39c21461-d044-42c3-8ac3-414ebd00977e).

#### Events

- Trade Show booths should default to using our general GitLab brand. General events such as these are organized by year within the repository.
- Recurring events that we host (Sales Kickoff, Contribute, Commit) have a different theme each year, which inspires a new creative direction. These events have their own folder, and are then organized within by year.

#### Brand Guidelines

The Brand Design team mantains the Brand Guidelines on [design.gitlab.com](https://design.gitlab.com/brand/overview) ([Pajamas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/tree/main)). For our team's purposes, we can make updates to the guidelines using [Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide_beta/#web-ide-beta). 

To get started, follow the workflow outlined below and check out our [demo](https://youtu.be/d8vUeHCkbnk) with the Product team.

**Using Web IDE**

1. Open [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/) and navigate to the page you need to make updates to. 
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Open Web IDE`.

**Pajamas structure**

Our Brand Guideline pages are located in the `Contents` folder and organized accordingly:

1. `brand:` This folder contains the Brand Guidelines Overview page.
1. `brand-design:` This contains pages related to design guidelines.
1. `brand-logo:` This contains pages relating to logo guidelines.
1. `static` > `img` > `brand:` The `brand` folder is where all media will be stored that links back to the Brand Guidelines.
1. `nav.json:` This file dictates the structure reflected in the navigation bar on Pajamas.

**Creating a new page**
1. Right click on the folder where the page will be located. Select `New File`.
1. Add your file name (this is what will be reflected in the URL path). End with the `.md` extension to denote a new markdown page. 
1. Update the navigation bar with your new page by opening the `nav.json` file.
1. Follow the [navbar configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/doc/navigation.md) to organize your pages. Nesting pages below other pages will create dropdowns in the navigation bar. 
   1. `title` is how you want your name to display on the page. 
   1. `path` is what is reflected in the URL path (this should match the file name of the page you made).

**Note:** Pajamas uses markdown and the heading styles match the handbook. Add content as you normally would. 

**Optimizing and uploading media**
1. `.svg` format is ideal because it scales with the page. Optimize your file before uploading by using [SVGO](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
1. `.png` or `.jpg` work well for graphics that contain images. [Optimize](https://tinypng.com/) your graphic before uploading.
1. `.gif` format is not accepted.
1. Upload all files to `static` > `img` > `brand` folder. 
1. Videos can be embedded (either from Vimeo or Youtube).

**Adding media**

Add media using `figures`, which connect the visual with a caption. Here is the breakdown of their structure:

1. `aria-label=` This text can be the same as the `fig caption`.
1. `img class=` This formats the image's display size. `img-50` scales the width down to 50% of the page. `gl-p-5` scales to the full width of the page.
1. `src=` This correspond's with the image's location. This should match the file name that corresponds with what you’ve uploaded to the `static` > `img` > `brand` folder.
1. `alt=` This is alternate text that displays in the case that the media does not populate on the page; this should be more descriptive and unique from the `aria-label` and `fig caption`.
1. `fig caption` This is the descriptive text displayed below the graphic.

**Pushing your merge request**

Smaller commits make collaboration easier. 

1. Use [conventional commits](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/blob/main/doc/commits.md#pajamas-commit-conventions). The title of your commit can be generic, and the merge request description can be more detailed. `Type:feature` covers most of the updates our team makes.
   1. `type:feature:` Effort to deliver new features, feature changes & improvements. 
   1. `type:maintenance:` Up-keeping efforts & catch-up corrective improvements that are not Features nor Bugs. 
   1. `type:bug:` Defects in shipped code and fixes for those defects. 
   1. **Commit example:** `feat(BrandMotion): embed samples`. 
      1. '_feat_' indicates the '_type_' of commit.
      1. '_BrandMotion_' identifies the page the changes were made to.
      1. '_embed samples_' describes the update that was made.
1. `push` your commit to a `new branch`. Then select `create MR`. 
1. Use the merge request description to add more detail that would be helpful for the reviewer. 
1. Assign the merge request to yourself. 
1. Add the label that reflects the commit type you made.
1. Select `create merge request`. 
1. Wait for the pipeline to complete, then assign either Jeremy or Taurie as the `reviewer`. 
1. Once the pipeline has passed, check out the `review app` to preview changes.
