## [Quarterly Earnings Customer References](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/customer-advocacy/earnings-support/)

Earnings statement customer reference identification and outreach is a continuous activity that occurs across each new quarter in support of the public earnings package. By identifying customers as part of this process, they enter the referencing “pipeline” to provide valuable proof points for the earnings statement and additional customer story content in the future.

Use the **Earnings Toolkit** to perform outreach, get customer legal permissions, and created the needed content. 

## Process for nominating new reference customers

***Please reach out to the Product CAB Manager (slack the cab-internal channel) before you nominate a customer for the Product CAB. Typically the customer profile is enterprise level with over 1200 licenses; however we review every nomination on its own merit***
