## Customer reference program at GitLab

The goal of the Customer Reference Program is to provide opportunities for customers to share their story on how GitLab has helped them overcome the challenges, blockers, and pain points within their organizations. The Reference Program Managers work as a conduit to help connect customers with opportunities by balancing customer requests with company demands. By providing a single point for outreach to customers, the CR team prevents customer burnout, sales team burnout, and ensures a diversity of customer assets are delivered to stakeholders.

### Customer references collection

### Customer Reference Types
Some examples of the types of assets we'd use as customer references once we have approval from the customer:
* Logo (The ability to name a company as a customer and use their logo in our marketing materials)
* Live sales reference (both calls and possible in-person)
* Website content
  * Written case studies and customer blogs (See [Customer Insight Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/customer-advocacy/customer-insight/) for case study process)
  * Blog posts
  * Videos
  * Podcasts
  * Usage quotes
* Event speakers (At industry, third-party and company events)
* References for analysts and press
* Quotes (can be attributable with approval or anonymous)
   

### Sample Interview Questions/topics for Customer joining the Reference Program (See [Customer Insight Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/customer-advocacy/customer-insight/) for case study and blog process)
    * What led you to GitLab, what problems were you trying to solve?
    * Why did you choose GitLab and what other tools were you using or considering?
    * What has been your experience with GitLab?  
    * How did you make the business case for GitLab and what metrics have you seen improve?
    * What have you heard from GitLab users, what was their adoption curve like?
    * What has been the most unexpected success you have experienced? Adoption rates? Improved speed?


### Customer Reference Request Rules of Engagement (Managing Volume & Frequency of Reference Customer Engagement Requests)
It is critical and the Customer Reference Management team’s responsibility to optimize our reference customer engagements to balance:
* Maximizing the positive impact of both the customer’s and GitLab’s investment of time and effort
* Ensuring continuous, long term customer and GitLab success by avoiding exhausting reference customer relationships<br>

By default, we will request a customer support reference call (sales/analyst relations/public relations) no more than once per quarter per customer. In support of event speaking and/or other participation support (field, alliance, digital, community, etc.), we will request customer support at a maximum of once every two quarters per customer. The CRM ultimately decides if the reference request is suitable for the proposed customer based on a number of factors including but not limited to:
* Past, current, and future planned volume
* Frequency
* Effort required of support requests
* Customer's stated comfortable volume and levels of engagement
