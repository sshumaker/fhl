# What does Product and Solution Marketing do?

Our mission is to accelerate GitLab’s path to market by developing insights, positioning, and messaging that communicate the value of our platform and solutions.

* We are core to GitLab’s go-to-market process, operating at the intersection of product management, sales, customer success, and marketing. 
* We help deliver a connected customer experience with every touchpoint reinforcing the brand, values, solutions, and vision of GitLab.
* We create programs and messaging to demonstrate momentum and trust in the market.

There are [10 key capabililities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SqvXqr7T4A9JS25QLA3y7lbgktG5d-rSVnrV-hgLRdI/edit?usp=sharing) of team members. Sub-teams and individuals typically 'major' in certain areas and 'minor' in others. It's rare that one person would be expert in all 10.

# <i class="fas fa-star fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i>Market Research and Insights

Product and Solution Marketing synthesizes customer knowledge, analyst views, market landscapes, and competitor intelligence, to provide marketing insights to GitLab marketing, sales, and product teams. We use these insights to inform the product team of key market requirements and evolving landscapes for their consideration in product strategy. Our research may also include primary research on customers, markets, and competitors.

Each team within Product and Solution Marketing contributes uniquely and equally toward gathering market insights:  
* Core Product Marketing - win/loss analysis, customer churn, customer interviews and deep dives, message testing with customers 
* Technical Marketing - User education/research via technical deep dives that includes workshops, interactive webinars, external evangelism, internal/external product enablement and analyst debriefings
* Marketing Research & Insights - primary and secondary research, market insight research, focus groups
* Customer Advocacy - customer reference interviews,  peer review curation, Customer Advisory Board (CAB)
* Analyst Relations - analyst inquiries/reports, message testing with analysts
* Competitive marketing - competitive messaging, competitive technical analysis


# <i class="fas fa-star fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i>Go-to-market (GTM) Strategies

We develop and champion **go-to-market strategies** that take into account our sales goals, product strengths/limitations, and marketing vehicles. These strategies include recommendations on product and solution areas upon which to focus our marketing and sales efforts and provide supporting messaging, positioning, personas, key assets/content, demos, sales enablement, and more. We deliver our stories/messages to customers, analysts, press through collateral, events, customer meetings, etc., where we get first-hand feedback from the audience to iterate and improve our strategies. We champion the customer perspective for continuity of experience across the various customer touchpoints.

Each team within Product and Solution Marketing contributes uniquely and equally toward a comprehensive GTM strategy that includes:  

   - characteristics of accounts and personas to pursue with marketing and sales, 
   - routes to market (e.g. direct, channels), 
   - key messages, 
   - currated assets/content needed for the buyer's journey, (this team creates many key assets but assets may also come from SAs, evangelists, blogs, partners. This team currates compelling ones that pull the prospect along their journey.)
   - key questions for sales to ask, competitive positioning, overcoming objections, other sales resources
   - influencing the influencers (press and analysts), responding to analyst RFIs for magic quadrants (MQs) and waves.

[Solutions GTM Page](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/) has links to all of this and more.


# <i class="fas fa-star fa-fw color-orange font-awesome"></i>Subject matter expertise 

Product Marketers are often asked to speak at conferences, workshops and webinars.

To encourage reuse and collaboration, we have a [shared folder of past abstracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ODXxqd4xpy8WodtKcYEhiuvzuQSOR_Gg) for different speaking events. PMMs also have an [inventory of presentations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQdR4mMNKWep0v02HQacOCEfb0BP19jFygTxnvUcau8/edit#gid=0) that can be quickly and easily reused.

Through research and iteration, Product and Solution Marketing becomes the subject matter experts around key product capabilities and/or solutions. We provide the voice of the customer to help to connect the dots across the marketing functions (web, campaigns, digital ads, ABM, events) and sales stages (SDR nurture, SALs/SAs pursuit/close, CSM expansion) by providing an outside-in perspective of our buyer's journey experience, along with that of their key influencers, from pain to purchase and from interest to sales. We strive to optimize the journey to efficiently achieve return on marketing and sales investment.

For info go to the [Sales Enablement page](/handbook/sales/training/sales-enablement-sessions/).



# Metrics

The Product and Solution Marketing organization is often considered the nexus that brings together research, customer and market insights, with technical expertise to benefit the all of GitLab marketing teams. The Product and Solution Marketing organization collaborates and partners with other teams in marketing for certain execution elements, such as Digital Experience, Brand, and Integrated marketing.  Additional key collaborators are sales for using the revenue plays for effective iteration, and Product Management to help with customer engagement via our CAB as well as providing input into analyst outreach.

The organization is an influencer on the indicators below. We cannot drive the results on our own, only through collaboration, but we use these indicators to assess the impact of our actions.

**Leading indicators**
* Position and progression in key MQs and Waves (identified by GTM Strategies)
* SEO of most critical terms (identified by GTM Strategies)
* [Content creation and use](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/metrics/)
* Percent of targeted ABM accounts that have engaged in a web page, event, asset, trial, or contacted sales.
* In [Brand surveys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsQo9-Kbp6IdEXUu3usyr2Cl8spVVIgsqXIAp2m1Awo/edit#), C-level and funnel prospects recognize GitLab for end-to-end DevOps capabilities.

**Lagging indicators**
* ARR for Enterprise and SMB
* First order new logos (is the message capturing new prospects?)
* Uptiering (are we arming sales with compelling offers?)
* Customer retention (are expectations set by marketing messages aligned with product experience?)
* Consistent outcomes from sales value plays (is the recipe a good one?)
