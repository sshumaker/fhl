This Forrester report talks about changing IT roles. They predict that key roles will become increasingly strategic and externally focused. They also believe that many of the roles, such as architects and developers, will require increased business knowledge, consulting skills, and responsibilities that span the enterprise rather than a narrow functional area, technology, or business unit. Agile methods and DevOps teams will be the defaults, and DevOps teams combined with Agile methods will become the accepted means of building capabilities.
