### Version 12 Year in Review

Leading into the GitLab 13.0 launch, [this blog post, including a video and slide deck](/blog/2020/05/21/version-12-year-in-review/) reviewed versions 12.0–12.10.

Major product themes are more apparent over this year of GitLab versions than they generally are in one month or quarter. For GitLab 12.x, these include "treating developers, security, and operations alike as first-class citizens in DevOps" and expanding the definition of DevOps and its practitioners, for example by building in Design Management and Requirements Management.

### 12.3–12.8 Sales enablement

This product release update covered 12.3–12.8 for FY21 Q1 and FY20 Q4, and was delivered 2020-02-27:

> GitLab 12.0 marks a key step in our journey to create an inclusive approach to DevSecOps, empowering 'everyone to contribute'.
>  
>  We believe everyone can contribute, and we’ve enabled cross-team collaboration, faster delivery of great code, and bringing together Dev, Ops, and Security.

</figure>

### 11.0 Launch

The theme of our 11.0 launch was [Auto DevOps](/stages-devops-lifecycle/auto-devops/) (as it had been for 10.0):

> Beyond making it easy to host and collaborate on public and private repositories, GitLab also simplifies the rest of the process by offering the whole delivery toolchain, built in. And now, it's not only built in, it's automated. Simply commit your code and Auto DevOps can do the rest. Auto DevOps is a pre-built, fully featured CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire delivery process.  

Read more in the 11.0 release blog post: [GitLab 11.0 released with Auto DevOps and License Management](/releases/2018/06/22/gitlab-11-0-released/).

### 10.0 Launch

The theme of our 10.0 launch was [Auto DevOps](/stages-devops-lifecycle/auto-devops/):

> From the formulation of an idea to executing and monitoring it in production, DevOps establishes a culture and environment where developing, testing, and releasing software can happen quickly, frequently, and more reliably.
>
> GitLab 10.0 delivers a hands-free DevOps environment with the introduction of Auto DevOps, allowing your team to easily configure and adopt modern development practices in your workflow.

Read more in the 10.0 release blog post: [GitLab 10.0 released with Auto DevOps and Group Issue Boards](/releases/2017/09/22/gitlab-10-0-released/).

## Planned updates

Product Marketing delivers quarterly product release update Sales enablement sessions. These are aligned with the product year, beginning with annual, major releases like 14.0 on 2021-06-22, which dovetailed with the GitLab 14 product launch. Major releases and launches may include looks back and forward, such as a "year in review" blog post.

Monthly release blog posts continue to announce monthly releases with Product Marketing support, though the introductions to release posts are now brief. Customer value-add is now described in the content blocks for headline and key features, in the body of each release post.

Version 14 enablements will include a GitLab 14 internal session for the Field, public Commit Virtual 2021 keynotes and talks that are product-related, a 14.1–14.4 quarterly session, and the FY23 SKO product keynote. We may also have an FY23Q2 session leading into the launch of GitLab 15.

*GitLab's annual, major release may move a month forward or back as needed. We moved Version 13 forward one month, leaving Version 12's last release as 12.10 rather than 12.11, to track our product year quarters with those of our fiscal year. We later added version 13.12 to the product year, shipped on 2021-05-22 and moving 14.0 back to 2021-06-22.*

## Purpose

Product Marketing delivers quarterly and annual, sales-centric updates of:

*  How recent product releases enhance GitLab's value proposition for solving customers' business problems
*  How these releases enhance the value of Premium and Ultimate
*  What is coming in the next quarter

This page merges release resources from Product and Marketing with related Sales Enablement pages, videos, and presentations. A "[handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first)" approach makes resources more findable and usable by Sales or anyone interested, and provides a stronger foundation for learning.
