# The Market Viewpoint

## Agile Planning and Management

By empowering teams, embracing change, and focusing on delivering value, Agile methodologies have transformed software development. Agile teams create more relevant, valuable, customer-centric products, more quickly than ever.

Development teams accelerate the delivery of value with iterative, incremental, and lean project methodologies including Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and more. Large enterprises have adopted Agile at enterprise scale through a variety of frameworks, including Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Spotify, Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), and others. GitLab enables teams to apply Agile practices and principles to organize and manage their work, whatever their chosen methodology. These new methodologies bring new challenges.

Agile is not a single methodology, but a set of guiding principles embraced by many methodologies in many ways. There is no single “best” way to plan and manage an Agile enterprise, and older project planning tools are often insufficiently flexible to address the needs of a given implementation.

This functionality gap leads to poor project estimation, planning, and progress tracking. Furthermore, Agile methodologies can create confusion between teams and throughout the enterprise, where even well-documented Agile processes may not map to traditional success metrics and waterfall financial planning.

Organizations need better ways to manage projects, programs, and portfolios using Agile. They need to better:

- **plan** and prioritize work based on strategic objectives
- **initiate** work
- **monitor** the progress of that work in progress
- **collaborate** on work, across teams, throughout the product lifecycle
- **control** and optimize the flow of work
- **close** work items when completed
- **measure** the value created by that work
- **communicate** that value throughout the organization, regardless of other methodologies in place

## Market Leaders

### GitLab

[GitLab was named a 'Leader' by Gartner in their 2021 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools](/analysts/gartner-eapt21/) after [entering the report as a Visionary just two years prior](/blog/2019/05/22/gitlab-identified-by-gartner-as-eapt-visionary/) and being a fairly recent entrant into the space.

_Gartner, “Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Agile Planning Tools,” Bill Blosen, Mike West, Deacon D.K Wan, Akis Sklavounakis, Keith Mann, Wan Fui Chan, Hassan Ennaciri, April 20, 2021._

Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in our research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation. Gartner research publications consist of the opinions of Gartner's research organization and should not be construed as statements of fact. Gartner disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to this research, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose._

### Atlassian

Average annual revenue growth of 40% over the last five years, [~$2B total revenue in 2020](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/shareholder-letter-q4fy21), and demand for remote working capabilities and SaaS during the global pandemic have propelled Atlassian (TEAM) to a $84B market capitalization as of 08-17-2021.

Atlassian has consistently increased its market footprint through strategic acquisitions that would allow its complimentary products to organically self-propagate through enterprises. At its Remote Summit in April, 2020, Atlassian announced many new capabilities in Jira Align, based on their $166 million acquisition of AgileCraft. AgileCraft, the company and the software, was a former market leader with support for SAFe and other enterprise Agile frameworks; it also featured strong support for teams using Atlassian Jira.

While Atlassian have many products, those most aligned with the Agile Use Case include Jira Software (Software Project Management), Jira Align (Portfolio Management), Confluence (Wiki), Trello (Project Management), Jira Core (Business Project Management), and Jira Service Desk (ITSM Software).

### CollabNet VersionOne

In 2019, TPG Capital purchased CollabNet VersionOne from Vector Capital as part of TPG’s $500M equity capital investment to build an integrated DevOps company called Digital.ai, which in 2020 also includes XebiaLabs and Arxan Technologies. Digital.ai provides end-to-end solutions for Global 5,000 enterprises.

Agile planning tools VersionOne and Continuum support Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and SAFe. [Value stream management](/solutions/value-stream-management/) and portfolio management have been more of a focus, and VersionOne is available as SaaS or on-prem. DevOps integrations include Jenkins, Chef, and others.

### Broadcom Rally

As [GitLab's Plan stage competitive landscape section](/direction/plan/#competitive-landscape) describes:

> Rally was the de facto market leader at one point in time, but has seen its market share decline substantially. While it is still entrenched in many enterprises, many speculate that Broadcom has placed Rally on life support.

Rally is part of Broadcom’s Digital BizOps Starter Edition and benefits from the company's larger presence, history, and product portfolio. Broadcom had acquired CA in 2018, for some time after which this product was still branded CA Agile Central.

### Planview

Planview provides a range of enterprise grade project, product, and portfolio management capabilities. Lead by investments from Venture Partners in 2013 and Thoma Bravo in 2017, Planview has been steadily acquiring competitors such as Troux Technologies, Innotas, LeanKit, and Spigit to expand its reach into different markets.

The product, Planview Lean and Agile Delivery, is said to have strong support for SAFe, Kanban, and Scrum, with Kanban useful outside of software development including portfolio management and business strategy.

### Apptio Targetprocess

On 02-11-2021, Apptio announced the acquisition of Targetprocess, one of the smaller and younger competitors in the plan space focused on PPM. Targetprocess has rapidly increased its market footprint and, like GitLab, has been recognized by Gartner as a leader in the EAPT market.

### Microsoft

With the acquisition of GitHub, Microsoft has begun the process of combining features of teh popular SCM solution with key features from Azure DevOps. Microsoft Project is their leading plan solution that currently owns 15-25% of the planning market.

### ServiceNow

While they are an established vendor in IT service management, ServiceNow's Agile planning tool, the IT Business Management (ITBM) suite is said to have relatively basic functionality. ITBM includes release planning, limited SAFe support, and Jenkins integration, while its main advantage would be integration with the Now Platform and generally unifying development and operations backlogs via ServiceNow.

## Trends

* From traditional project planning toward higher-level portfolio planning
* Increased importance of visibility and value stream management
* Increased interest in enterprise frameworks such as SAFe, LeSS, and the Spotify model
* Continued expansion of the Agile use case beyond software development
* Increased importance of coherence with compliance and business leadership
* Increased importance of Agile tools producing, integrating with, and being guided by data

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths

- As a single DevOps Platform, GitLab allows organizations to plan and manage work in the same system where they perform it

- Our transparency and accordant willingness to be direct with, and meaningfully involve customers.

- GitLab's own modern but flexible software, from basis in Git to cloud integrations, positions us for the future and to be agile in our support of customers adopting Agile.

- The growth of DevOps is concurrent and may be symbiotic with that of Agile, and our reputation in DevOps precedes us.

### Weaknesses

- GitLab's portfolio management capabilities are currently less mature than some more specialized competitive point solutions.

- Our MVC-based iterative approach to developing and deploying GitLab can initially jarring to prospective customers from more traditional, less Agile organizations.

- We're a relatively new player in the market.

### Opportunities

GitLab is positioned for the future, with points including our ascendancy in DevOps, the trend toward platforms over DIY point solutions, our strength in DevOps for enterprise customers, and our own modern approach and architecture, optimized for cloud native applications. As a newer entrant to the space, GitLab is also unburdened by legacy code and processes and able to create a new Agile management paradigm that is more flexible and better-designed for coming changes in demand.

### Threats

The mergers and acquisition landscape indicates that competitors are working on building or acquiring end-to-end platforms like GitLab, potentially mitigating against a key differentiator.

Larger players such as Microsoft and Atlassian have resources enabling them to close or open gaps quickly in Agile and adjacent areas.

As Agile becomes ever more mainstream, expansion may become more difficult per more stubborn shadow IT and resistance to change.

## Personas

### User Personas

With GitLab's unique capability to connect every phase of the Software Development Lifecycle in a single DevOps platform, many user personas find a solution in Integrated Agile Planning.

User personas and their key motivations for using GitLab for Agile planning include:

#### [Parker the Product Manager](/handbook/product/personas/#parker-product-manager)

- PMs coordinate feature development and project success, along with general workload. Abilities to monitor progress through commits and the review app, and to validate those changes and provide feedback, are key to their success.

#### [Delaney the Development Team Lead](/handbook/product/personas/#delaney-development-team-lead)

- Like PMs, Team Leads need to understand their team's capacity to assign upcoming tasks and meet goals on time.

In consideration: personas from an Agile Planning perspective might include and be named as:

- Scrum Master
- Product owner
- Developer
- Tester/QA
- Project managers
- Product managers

### Buyer Personas

Purchasing for Integrated Agile Planning may not require executive involvement, with one possible exception being the influence of the [VP Application Development](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/).

#### [Erin the Application Development Executive (VP, etc.)](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/)

- Erin is a strategic leader focused on business challenges and the big picture.
- Erin's top goal is predictable business results.
