title: "103 - Maintaining common slides across decks"
---
## Objective
  Marketing creates and maintains quite a few presentations for various stakeholders - like analysts, sales, customers. Some of the commonly maintained presentations are available in the [sales resources handbook page](https://gitlab.highspot.com/spots/615dd7e3911d70c4887812a7). There is common content across the slides. The focus of this page is to explain how we manage common slides across various presentations that strategic marketing creates for various stakeholders.

### Single directory with commonly used slides
  All common slides will be maintained as individual slides in this strategic marketing [master slides folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J6bWYACPbgCRlLx0HmdEC0FtOZ017_L1). The most recent and up to date version of the common slides will be maintained in this folder.
