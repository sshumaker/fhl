# The GitLab Brand Strategy team

The Brand Strategy team is responsible for accelerating GitLab’s path to market by creating awareness, trust, and affinity for the GitLab brand. 

## Meet the team: 

- Rebecca Clayman: Director of Brand Strategy - `@rclayman` 
- Matthew Jordan: Senior Brand Manager - `@jmatthewj`
- Betsy Bula: Senior Brand Manager - `@bbula` 

We’re part of the broader [Brand and Product Marketing team](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/) at GitLab, and we’re close counterparts of the Brand Creative team. Looking for design-related resources? Check out the [Brand Creative handbook](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/design/). 

# What we do 

Our team's work falls into four pillars: 

- **Brand research:** Measuring the health of our brand—including awareness, consideration, competitive positioning, and more—with surveys and research studies.
- **Brand messaging**: Umbrella-level messaging that defines our brand and positions GitLab as an industry leader.
- **Brand marketing:** Building awareness via always-on marketing campaigns.
- **Brand governance:** Empowering internal and external advocates to become brand champions.

In FY24, our goal is to establish a global, always-on digital presence with breakthrough awareness-building and thought leadership campaigns that position GitLab as the leading DevSecOps platform.
