## Wil's README

Hi there! I'm Wil, and I'm the head of social media at GitLab.

I've spent my career in and around full time social media roles in community, advertising, strategy, people management, and more. I've worked with B2B and B2C brands, from agency to brand side, with tech companies, restaurants, Fortune 500s, regulated industries, and many projects in between.

## About me
* I've lived all over the United States: Wilmington, DE; Atlanta, GA; Los Angeles, CA; Orlando, FL; Stamford, CT; and Worcester, MA. A lot of these places were a part of a life of traveling for work, when I worked in the entertainment industry.
* I grew up a major professional wrestling fan and worked my entire life to work for the largest wrestling company in the world. I ended up working for someone I admired and watched on television for 15 years. It was a lesson in learning about work styles, company culture and values, and realizing what was important to me.
* I also grew up very poor and generally disadvantaged, which gave me a lot of lessons about culture and heirarchy. So, I naturally find all authority figures untrustworthy and suspicious until I've built some rapport with them. This also means that I take my roles as an authority figure very seriously.
* I have a number of neurological differences that make the way I send and receive communications different than most folks. The next two sections below include details that can help us communicate better together.

## How you can help me
* Have a [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action). Instead of waiting, move problems forward with a merge request or issue by default.  
* Connect the dots. Relate issues and merge requests to each other where applicable.
* I interpret silence as "everything is fine", if that's not true, please reach out to me.
* I like explicit asks. ‚ÄúTake a look‚Äù is less helpful than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for feedback on X and Y, by end of month‚Äù. Help me understand the scope. If you don't, I'll be asking follow up questions.
* I can't operate well without knowing "the why" behind actions and changes. It gives me air to breath when I understand why something is changing, moving, iterating in a particular why. Please try to include this when your explaining anything new to me. Without "the why", it might not be possible for me to understand the work.
* Operate using GitLab's [values](/handbook/values/) as your guide. If you notice me straying from our values, help me back on track. Expect me to do the same with you.

## How you can work with me
- **Be explicit** - include the details you are thinking about that impact my perception of the work
- **Be direct** - try to talk me about the work, concerns, etc. directly - "beating around the bush" is difficult for me to comprehend. I have difficulty with subtext, so communicating to me with "things left unsaid" or "assuming I will understand" will not actually be communicated to me.
- **Expect follow up questions** - rarely do I feel like I have all of the information I need to make decisions or move forward. No matter what you've prepared or how you've communicated it to me, I will likely have follow up questions. 
- **Don't expect my thoughts on new information synchronously** - Neurologically, I will not provide the best response in a meeting when discussing new information. I need a few moments to digest the information and process it. Sometimes this can happen with a few seconds of silence in a meeting. Most of the time, I will need to say that I will get back to you and tag you with my response in the agenda or issue. 
- **Assume what I am saying is exactly what I mean** - Because of my neurological differences, subtext is difficult for me so I tend to not use it. I recognize that this is very different than what many people experience. However, please try to keep in mind that there are no hidden meanings to my words. I am not trying to say something that is left unsaid. (I also have difficulty processing subtext, hence the first two points, being explicit and direct)
- **Default to async as often as appropriate** - Working asynchronously allows me to process information in ways that are friendlier to my brain. It is also a part of GitLab's way of working. 


## My working style
* DiSC Assessment: `DC`
   - Goals: Independence, accomplishment
   - Expect from others: Competence, common sense
   - When under pressure, I'm overly critical.
   - Questioning, skeptical, and prioritizes results.
* MBTI: `INTP-T` (but 49/51 borderline with several others) [see the data here ](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/963587215e246)
   - "[The Turbulent Logician](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)"
   - Role: Analyst / Strategy: Constant Improvement
   - *"The Logician personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there‚Äôs nothing they‚Äôd be more unhappy about than being ‚Äúcommon‚Äù.*

* **I maintain "scheduled" work blocks and shift by season**. Generally, I still work during the day and use off-hours time to aid in staying flexible for the demands of life. E.g., in the wintertime, I'll likely shift my work day to start later in the morning to accomodate my perception of time during the dark months.
* **I like to keep meetings minimized, but also recurring when appropriate**. I believe that our face time aids in our asynchronous work, so even if we just want to catch up personally, if we're only meeting once ever 6-8 weeks, I'd prefer to keep it on the calendar. 
* **I need to block time in 2+ hour sessions to feel like I can move forward and pay attention to my work**. I use Clockwise to manage my calendar, so you'll see more meetings on TUE and THUR and no meetings on MON or FRI (with WED being flexible to the demands of the week). This helps me to maintain blocks of time to put the work in and to think critically about what I'm contributing to. 
* Working at GitLab
   - **I work in my issue boards**. Therefore, work doesn't exist to me without it being in an issue, assigned to a milestone, and has the "social media" label. For one off items, you'll find that I assign myself things in Google Docs from meetings. Please feel free to do the same, if we're not capturing our work in an issue. 
   - **I manage my to-do's for quick asynchronous exchanges**. This is usually where I see our conversation if we weren't actively working together on an issue or you've tagged me in a comment with an update. I clean to-do's out every week, and I am usually in them multiple times a day. 
   - **I see Slack as conversational and not real to our work**. If either of us have committed to doing something, we ought to get it into an issue and link there before the conversation is over.
   - **I rarely check emails**. Most takeaways in email need to be translated into a GitLab issue or merge request, so start there if at all possible. When I see new emails, I think "external to GitLab".

## What I assume about others
* [Positive intent](/handbook/values/#assume-positive-intent).
* You‚Äôre the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) for your work. You‚Äôre better at your job than I am.
* You‚Äôll ask for my input and help if it‚Äôs needed. 
* You have more going on than the one thing we're discussing. 

## What's my current role and goal?
As I lead social media at GitLab, ultimately everything I do is to better tie social media into our body of work as a company and to build a self-service culture of social media as a practice. What does that mean in real life? Sometimes it's bringing listening data to a call or a Slack chat that would otherwise not have had data to make decisions around, or it's when we're speaking in #HashtagsForCampaigns or #HashtagForEvents so that the practice becomes fluid. But most times, it shows up when our team brings our experiences and know-how for our everchanging channels to our larger marketing team, helping others to express their messages through social channels.

* I collaborate with every part of GitLab to better tell our story, share our message, and generate awareness.
* I help to build step-and-repeat practices and workflows to every area of the company social works with. 
* I educate team members on those same social practices, so that they can learn as much as possible through a self-service mindset.
* I help our team to remove obstacles, get to the simple solution, and keep us iterating further.
* And sometimes, I tweet. üòâ
