### Simpli5
[https://www.simpli5.com](https://www.simpli5.com/)

I am energetic, ambitious, and adventurous. I welcome challenges and will not be diverted from my purpose. Instead, I am determined to work on a project tirelessly to bring it to completion. I take advantage of new opportunities better than most people. Life for me can be a vibrant affair in which I passionately pursue success, experience, and achievement. I am dramatic, idealistic, proud, and self-assured with a creative mind.

People love relating to me personally and professionally, whether one-on-one or in a group setting. They feel safe and secure knowing that I am:

- Listening to their needs;
- Taking care of business by putting a thorough action plan into place;
- Intelligent and creative enough to solve any spontaneous problems by considering various options;
- Capable of motivating and leading them toward successful outcomes.

I am an innovative thinker with an actively curious and very quick mind. With my talent for grasping abstract concepts, I learn new ideas quickly and easily.

I turn thought into action almost instantly. When I get an idea, I become excited, get others excited about it, then act on it. I can become so involved in my pursuit of success that I forget to tend to the necessary details and planning along the way. I must learn to discern good ideas from bad ones and, most of all, to make a clear outline of the steps, procedures, and deadlines needed to proceed successfully.

    - **Coordinate:** Amazing products are the result of teamwork. We need to communicate effectively as a team and coordinate our efforts to deliver a product that our customers will love.

- Please come prepared with 4-5 things you'd like to discuss.
- You can expect I'll ask the following questions from [The Coaching Habit](https://boxofcrayons.com/the-coaching-habit-book/). I find them incredibly useful:
1. What's on your mind?
2. And what else?
3. What's the real challenge here for you?
4. What do you want?
5. How can I help?
6. If you're saying Yes to this, what are you saying No to?
7. What was most valuable to you?
- Help me calibrate my leadership style by sharing what I should be doing more of/less of (I have thick skin, don't worry 😀).
- Please do not feel you have to wait for a 1:1 to bring anything up; my door/calendar is always open.

## Coaching Me
- Allow me to use initiative and autonomy; impose a minimum of routine.

- Be organized. I can be impatient with confusion, vagueness, and lack of time integrity.
- Immediately present the goals, objectives and expectations. Be sure to articulate what success looks like.
- Express appreciation personally but without excessive sentiment.
- Categorize. I organize information in mental boxes for quicker recall.
- I want to improve. Criticize and correct me gently, and be reassuring.

## Final Thought
The way I see it, life is short, we're all trying our best, so let's make awesome sh*t together.
