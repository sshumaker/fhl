## Overview

### Why should you care about GitOps?

- The [GitOps Marketing campaign](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/1183) has produced the highest amount of linear SAOs across all segments since launch in April 2020
- Over 45% of our [survey respondents at Kubecon EU](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/corporate_marketing/corporate-marketing/-/issues/4792) highlighted that GitOps is a priority for their organization in the short term.
- The interest in GitOps topics was so HIGH that CD Conference (by CNCF) had to spin up a separate [GitOps Conference](https://hopin.com/events/gitops-con) 
- GitOps helps you target a completely new persona and usecase - opening up [new land and expand opportunities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/1183#sample-deals-from-fy21) for you


### What is GitOps?

If the above has gotten you excited, learn more [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o728pUdk1rrNqWAZpzZVdfZ3gzADvTXSssVzqL-6WB4/edit#slide=id.g8d846209b0_25_172) about GitOps, why it's important for your customers and how we are different.

Simply said - GitOps takes DevOps best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to infrastructure automation.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

### Who to meet  {#who-to-meet}
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

The persona interested in GitOps is in general different from your development or engineering organizations. They are most often from the operations, systems, infrastructure, platform and cloud side of the organization. 

| | Typical Roles | Typical Titles |
| - | ----------- | -------------- |
| **Economic Buyer** | Director/VP/CIO of IT, Head of IT Infrastructure / Platform Engineering / Operations | SVP of Technology Operations, Sr. Manager Systems Engineering, Cloud Architect, Information Systems Architect |
| **User** | SRE, Infra Engineer, Sys Admin, Platform Engineer - have to execute frequent repetitive tasks to support dynamically changing elastic environments | DevOps engineer, Architect, Team Lead, DevOps Ninja |

More details [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#personas)

### Keywords to listen for  {#keywords}
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

| Infrastructure as code | GitOps | Infrastructure automation |
| Configuration as code | Policy as code | Approvals for infrastructure changes |
| Terraform | Ansible | AWS Cloud formation |
| Weaveworks Flux | Argo CD | Terraform Cloud |

#### How to identify interest based on activity {#identify-interest}

Customers engage with our content from our website, collaterals, videos and campaigns. We can identify a customer's interest levels based on their latest activity - which you can see on SFDC.

1. [Identify the Last Interesting moment](#lim-anchor)
1. [Identify the topics in the Top consumed content and time spent on it](#lim-anchor)

If both of these include GitOps keywords or GitOps topics - ensure to have the GitOps conversation. 

#### Targeted leads are waiting for attention

Marketing is running a related demand gen campaign.  

* A Demand Generation campaign is running across different channels (LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Search...) surfacing new leads from the Focus Account Lists, ICP Total Addressable Market, and Volume accounts. See the flow of the Marketing campaign [here](https://app.mural.co/t/gitlab2474/m/gitlab2474/1620648875422/b0575eec3f6839f6fd9672f34dfb5ca022b422f3?sender=epan1035) 
* A series of virtual events are scheduled throughout FY22, targeting new and existing Inquiries. Schedule of upcoming Infrastructure Automation/GitOps GTM related virtual events can be found in the [FY22 All-Marketing Calendar SSoT](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2V3Aj1l_UT5hEb54nczzinGUxtxswZBhZV8r9eErqM/edit#gid=571560493&fvid=1570851636)



### Value discovery {#value-discovery}
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

### Common Pains  {#common-pains}

| Challenges "before scenarios" | So What? "negative consequences" |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| - How does your infrastructure team manage configurations, policies, variables etc consistently across your infrastructure? | No consistency, no knowledge sharing, no version control, click ops |
| - Are you able to ensure that changes are reviewed and approved by the right individuals - to ensure minimal disruption to your staging / production environments? | Higher risk as unauthorized changes can be shipped to production - causing performance issues / downtime, high skilled / highly paid resources may be doing menial tasks |
| - Is your infrastructure team able to consistently repeat the steps to setup an environment every single time? | No standardization, manual process - more error prone |

More questions [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#discovery-questions)


### Common benefits  {#common-benefits}

| Desired Future State (“After Scenarios”) | So What? (“Positive Business Outcomes”) |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| More automation | Less risk as manual repetitive tasks are error prone |
| Faster mean time to repair | Can be rolled back rapidly to a working definition of the infrastructure rather than troubleshooting before roll-back - resulting in faster time to repair |
| Faster time to value | Move from manual Click ops to GitOps to deploy more often |
| Compliant | Compliance is automated as every change is tracked |
| Reduced security exposure | All changes can be reviewed and approved, security for infrastructure code can be embedded within the pipeline |


### Required capabilities  {#required-capabilities}

'GitOps = Infrastructure as Code + Merge Request + CI/CD'

| Required capability	 | Customer Metrics |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Version control for infrastructure code | Improved time to value - less manual, less error prone, more automated |
| Change control and collaboration for infrastructure | Lower change failure rate - more controls, more reviews and approvals |
| Compliance & Auditing | Lesser time spent in auditing, fewer compliance issues |
| CI/CD - test automation, pipeline configuration management | Higher deployment frequency - more automation |
| Rollback |  Lower mean time to repair - can roll back to working definition of infra before troubleshooting |


## Positioning value  {#positioning-value}
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}


### Elevator pitch

Have you faced infrastructure downtime and have not been able to trace it back to who made the changes, what changes were made and who approved it? Infrastructure automation with GitLab helps you bring Application DevOps best practices of collaboration, version control, CI/CD & Compliance to Infrastructure.

### Value Proposition (How GitLab does it?)

Unlike other vendors, GitOps with GitLab helps you manage physical, virtual and cloud native infrastructures. We use a tight integration with industry-leading infrastructure automation tools like Terraform, AWS Cloud Formation, and the like to meet you where you are - all with a single application.

Detailed section on How GitLab meets the market requirements [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#market-requirements)

### Differentiators (How GitLab does it better?)

- Most competitive solutions require 5-6 integrations to achieve the GitOps workflow. GitLab offers version control, CI/CD and container registry & out of the box integration for config management, orchestration & infra provisioning.
- Better traceability across the workflow - GitLab can tie an infrastructure deployment all the way back to the change that was made - which is difficult in a workflow that is tied together with multiple solutions.
- Most competitors support predominantly cloud native - GitLab meets customers where they are supporting On-premise & cloud, physical, virtual, cloud native infrastructures
- Agent-based and Agentless approach - giving customers a choice to pick the right approach for their environments

More details [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#top-3-differentiators)

### Competitors
Primary competitors: Flux (Weaveworks), Argo CD, Terraform Cloud
Secondary competitors: Codefresh, Transposit, Red Hat/IBM

Detailed competitive against primary competitors [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#competitive-comparison)

### Handling Objections

Typical questions:
- I don't use Kubernetes, so GitOps is not relevant for me
- Our environment is too complex for GitOps
- GitOps gives more access to developers to fiddle with deployments, and infra teams are not comfortable with that
- (Infra / DevOps Engineer) I'm going to lose control over my work and environment

Detailed list of Q&A [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/gitops/#objection-handling)

1. Understand their technical requirements. For example, look to get answers to the following technical discovery questions:
  - Do their applications require a hybrid cloud infrastructure or multi-cloud?
  - Do they have any hard-dependencies on any infrastructure-as-code tool? e.g. Terraform, Ansible, etc.
  - Do they need GitOps for K8s, non-K8s or both?
  - In the case of K8s, are their clusters available outside their firewall?
1. Be prepared to do some competitive [objection handling](#handling-objections)

#### During evaluation
1. Prepare your own GitOps environment for demo purposes by following the steps from the [GitOps lab](https://gitlab.com/tech-marketing/workshops/cicd/cd-labs-instructions/-/blob/master/11.%20GitOps%20with%20GitLab.md) of the SA CD Workshop.

### Services {#services}

GitLab Professional Services help customers become efficient in GitLab quickly. GitLab (or a GitLab partner) offers a number of service offerings to support customers. 

For the GitOps sales play, consider asking your customer about their workforce's proficiency with git, GitLab, and GitLab CI as they are foundational elements to GitOps. If they are not strong in all of these topics, consider positioning [GitLab with git Basics training](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/gitlab-basics/) and/or [GitLab CI/CD training](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/gitlab-ci/). 

Advisory/Consulting services to help with GitOps rollout are planned to be rolled out later this year. Please register your interest for a GitOps Advisory offering [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ps-leadership-team/ps-practice-management/-/issues/74) to help PS effectively prioritize!
