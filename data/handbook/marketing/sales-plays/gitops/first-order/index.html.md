### Part 1: Before the Discovery Call

| Before the Discovery Call |
| ------ |
| 1. Familiarize yourself with the [GitOps Sales Play](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/) and watch the [enablement video](https://youtu.be/aXg3zGg54sg). |
| 2. Talk to the right persona - typically not a developer, could be a team lead, system architect, or cloud architect from the infrastructure/operations side of the house. |
| 3. Check that the [last interesting moment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#lim-anchor) and [top content viewed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#lim-anchor) is related to GitOps. |
| 4.  Create a custom pitch deck incorporating these [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YH6zcNQ9EbtvsLsiI3kKb4tMIW3SUwKcUc-7GEK3woQ/edit?usp=sharing) as needed. ([GitOps messaging](https://youtu.be/JtZfnrwOOAw) and [original deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18cuZjvkMT8uv241dqJZMdaWOyvZiwBOzFvRZ4HaP1iE/edit#slide=id.g8d846209b0_25_172)). |

| 2. Familiarize yourself with the top [discovery questions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#value-discovery), [objection handling](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#handling-objections) and [differentiators](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-plays/gitops/#differentiators-how-gitlab-does-it-better) for GitOps. *NOTE: This is very different from other conversations - the persona we talk to is different.* |
| 3. Identify business objectives and priorities during discovery. These could be:<br> - Infrastructure automation<br> - Managing cloud native environments<br> - multi-cloud / kubernetes adoption<br> - compliance related to infrastructure. |
| 4.  After your call, follow up with an [email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSwEBCxkQMgMmtLKocNfP0EKTLnWIr2FZimG0yv1gTM/edit#bookmark=id.vk2ta1k8w0re), which should include:<br> - any information they requested ([resources](https://learn.gitlab.com/l/gitops-gtm-content) you might include),<br> - how that information can be helpful for their research,<br> - an offer to continue researching these topics on their behalf,<br> - mutually agreed upon next steps.
