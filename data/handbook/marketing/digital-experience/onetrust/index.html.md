## Implementation

[See the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1265) for more information.

## Cookie Compliance 

### Scanning a Website

The scanner simulates a user from Ireland (where OneTrust servers are located).

1. Navigate to the cookie compliance module via the "home screen" after login and clicking on the cookie compliance tile or by clicking the "launchpad" icon in the top left corner next to the home icon.
1. Click the `Add Website` button.
1. Best practice: Add the root domain to scan without `www`. If you scanned a domain with `www` it will not capture domains with prefixes. 
1. Choose the `GitLab` organization to assign the domain scan to.
1. Under `More Details`, you have additional options to use in the scan including limiting the scan to a number of pages (default is 1,000), limiting to a specific path within the site, clearing previous scan history, scanning pages with query parameters, targeting pages to scan within the site, or including sitemaps URIs. 

#### Website scan menu

In the list of websites that have been scanned, you can hover over any domain and click the 3-dot icon on the right-hand side. Clicking this icon provides additional options for that particular website scan including:

1. Re-scan: re-scans the website and provides additional options for the re-scan.
1. Re-process
1. Reassign: reassign to a different organization
1. Login: This option gives you the ability to scan behind a login or web form; if clicked, you'll be redirected to the website details to provide additional information; you can gather the web form HTML attributes by using the `Inspect` feature in Google Chrome
1. Schedule: schedule a future scan (default: every 3 months for every quarter of the year); option to notify a user once completed
1. Stop: stop a pending scan
1. Delete: delete a scan
1. Export scan results
1. Get help

### Configuring a Website Scan

#### More scan details

1. **Limit scan to 1000 pages:** If you want to limit the scan to a number of pages. Note that as you increase the amount of pages to scan, the longer the scan will take to complete.
1. **Limit to this path within site:** OneTrust considers `about.gitlab.com/fr` and `about.gitlab.com` 2 separate domains with this option enabled.
1. Clear previous scan history: Does not delete previous data; scanner treats the domain as if its the first time scanning; (use case: significant cookie or design change on the website)
1. **Scan pages with query parameters:** scan URLs with query parameters (ex: about.gitlab.com?utm_source=marketo); Input field example: `name=first,name=last`. Separate multiple parameters with commas. The scan will search through the domain with those noted parameters. Ensure the domain you enter includes `?` at the end of the URL.
1. **Target pages to scan:** Input exact URL site with full `https://` ; use case: certain pages that might not be accessible to users or you want to scan this specific web page. For multiple pages, add a line break.
1. **Sitemap URIs:** Input sitemap URL with `https://` with `.xml`. 

### Scheduling Cookie Scans

1. From the website scan menu, highlight the domain you wish to create scan schedule for.
1. Click the 3-dot menu.
1. Select `Schedule`. 
1. The default is set to every 3 months for every quarter of the year; You can also select a specific date.
1. Optional: enter an email address to notify a user once a scheduled scan is completed.

### Viewing Scan Results

When a scan is completed, you can view the results by clicking into the scan from the `Websites` menu. You'll be taken to a scan dashboard that visualizes the results of the scan which includes information about:

1. Tracking technology
1. Cookies with category
1. Tags
1. Forms
1. Pages
1. Local storage

On the `Show` dropdown, you can view a summary of all scans for that particular domain and view previous individual scans with a date/time stamp.

From the main scan results page, you can also select these 6 categories to dive further into those specific results.

#### Cookie scan results

View categories of cookies including the name of the specific cookie. This information comes from and is compared to [OneTrust's cookie database](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/). You can export these results by clicking `Export` in this view. After clicking `Export` you can choose the specific scan to export results from. When the export is ready for download, a notification will appear within the OneTrust tenant as the bell icon in the top-most menu.

### Exporting Scan Results

From the bell icon, you can download the results (`.xlsx`).

### Categorizing Cookies

1. Navigate to `Categorizations` in the left-hand menu of the cookie compliance module. 
1. Click `Categories`.
1. Clicking the arrow on a respective category will expand the description of this cookie category. This description is what users will see. 
1. Click the pencil icon to edit the cooke category description. **Important:** You must confer with the GitLab legal team before updating these descriptions as they must strictly align with our policies regarding cookie use. 

These cookie categories are standard and the defaults provided by OneTrust: 

1. **Strictly necessary cookies ID C0001:** the website needs these cookies in order to function properly (example: identify items placed into a shopping cart)
1. **Performance cookies ID C0002:** get information about how site visitors are using the website (example: Google analytics)
1. **Functional cookies ID C0003:** provide additional enhancement of the experience of site visitors (example: language selector for localization)
1. **Targeting cookies ID C0004:** cookies that attempt to gather more information about a user in order to personalize marketing (example: remarketing)
1. **Social media cookies ID C0005:** social media services added to the site that enable users to share content with their friends and networks easily

You also have the ability to create a new cookie category.

Cookies in the `Unknown` category need to be categorized manually with help from developers, third-party vendors, or through a Google search.

### Adding, Editing, and Removing Cookies

1. Navigate to the `Cookies` tab under the `Categorizations` menu.
1. View the list of cookies that have been identified and categorized, including the domain where it was identified, the lifespan of the cookie, the hostname, and the description.
1. Click into each cookie individually to view more information about that cookie. 
1. In the `Edit Cookie` overlay, you can select a different category for the cookie, add a description for the cookie, update the lifespan of the cookie, note whether it's a first-party or third-party cookie, and select the domains to manually assign the cookie to. Changing the lifespan of the cookie is for auditing purposes and does not change the functionality on the website.
1. Manually add a cookie to a particular domain if you don't wish to run the domain through a scan in order to pick it up. Click `Add Cookie` to manually add a cookie and input all the information regarding that cookie from step 4. **Note:** Host is not necessarily the domain where the cookie is but where the cookie is hosted. This will not add the cookie to the domain you input, but rather an existing cookie on the domain that is not part of the audit.
1. You also have the option to bulk categorize cookies by selecting multiple cookies from the list. Select all cookies or specific cookies from the list, then click the double-arrow icon to bulk edit the categories of those cookies.
1. Use the search bar to search for specific cookies by the cookie name or the host name. 
1. Use the filter icon to filter down to specific types of cookies by their category, domain, lifespan, or hostname (example: only view functional cookies). 

### Adding, Editing, and Managing Cookie Compliance Templates

1. Capture records of consent: cookie ID associated with each user; the consent module logs those preferences. 
1. Advanced analytics: sends browser type, device type, and country where the user consented. This information will be shown in the dashboard. Toggle this to a specific cookie category (example: performance cookies for Google analytics). 

#### Assigning a Geolocation Rule Group to Domains

**Assigned domains**

1. Click `Assign to Domains`.
1. Select the domains you would like to assign the geolocation rule to.

1. **Opt-out consent model:** If you select Opt-out, all cookie categories (besides Strictly Necessary) will be set to Active. These cookies will be automatically enabled when the visitor lands on the website. The website visitor can disable the non-Strictly Necessary cookies in the preference center.
1. **Implied consent:** all cookie categories (besides Strictly Necessary) will be set to Inactive Landing Page. These cookies are not set until the website visitor clicks the OK button on the cookie banner or continues browsing the website. The website visitor can disable cookie categories in the preference center.
1. **Notice only:** If you select Notice Only as the default consent model, all cookie categories will be set to Always Active and cannot be disabled by website visitors. A banner informing the visitor that the website uses cookies will be displayed on the landing page of the website.
1. **Custom:** If you select this option, you can set a different default status for each category of cookie on your site. You can customize the consent model to suit your organization's needs and can set the Do Not Track status for each category of cookie.

### Banner Rules 

The OneTrust banner is only visible to new website visitors based on a set of logic listed below. In regions where the banner does not display, the user can still consent to cookie categories from the Preference Center window by clicking on the "Cookie Settings" or "Do not sell..." link located in the footer section. 

| Region   | Consent Model | Banner Visibility    | Buttons    |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| California    | Opt out       | Not visible          |     |
| Colorado   | Opt out       | Not visible          |     |
| US     | Opt out       | Not visible          |       |
| Europe, Colombia, Russia, Liechtenstein, United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Peru | Opt in        | Visible to new users | Cookie Settings, Accept All Cookies  |
| Korea, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Macao   | Opt out       | Visible to new users | Cookie Settings, Accept All Cookies  |
| France, Spain     | Opt in        | Visible to new users | Cookie Settings, Reject All, Accept All Cookies |
| Global     | Opt out       | Not visible          |              |

### Accessing Scripts

1. To access the scripts, click `Scripts` in the left menu of the `Cookie Compliance` module. 
1. Click the domain where the script will be implemented. 
1. Any time a change is made to a domain within the OneTrust tenant, those changes must be published to production in order for the users to see those changes reflected in the cookie banner, preference center, etc. 

#### Testing

Test scripts are available to roll out new changes. The test scripts are not domain specific. The test script matches the production script functionality except:

1. There is no cache, meaning changes can be viewed immediately.
1. This script will function on your test site and should be used for testing purposes only.

Publishing the test scripts will not affect the live production scripts. 

#### Production

Production scripts are for use in live websites. Fastest page load speed. Published changes will take up to 4 hours to show.

**The script tags need to be placed as the first element in the `<head>` of the site. It is important that the OneTrust script is placed before other scripts on the site to ensure users have a chance to consider their cookie preferences before cookies are potentially dropped on their machines.**

Scripts implemented in root domains are also applied to subsequent subdomains and paths. Scripts implemented on subdomains are only applied to subdomains. 

In order to push changes to production, click `Publish Production Scripts` and note any changes to the script as you may have to re-copy and re-implement the script in the `<head>` of the site.

### Script Version

Click `Publish Test`. Here you can choose which version of the script to publish. You will also be alerted to which features may or may not be compatible with a script version including the field name, old value, and new value. Click `Confirm`. 

### Publication Settings

Here you can confirm the publication settings of the script. Note: enabling or disabling some of these settings may change the embed script and would have to be re-implemented on the site.

1. **Publish individual languages:** when toggle is `off`, all languages will be published
1. **Do you require users to re-consent?** Switching to IAB TCF 2.0 requires that your users re-consent, as preferences have changed. TCF 2.0 is not backwards compatible with TCF 1.0
1. **Prevent fetching banner:** When toggle is `on`, the banner template HTML and CSS will not be fetched from server as the `otSDKStub.js` loads
1. **Prevent fetching preference center:** When toggle is `on`, the preference center template HTML and CSS will not be fetched from server as the `otSDKStub.js` loads
1. **Enable automatic blocking of cookies:** If enabled, cookies will automatically be blocked until user has consented. Auto-blocking will block scripts that drop cookies categorized outside of strictly necessary on page load automatically
1. **Enable language detection on scripts:** if the language cannot be determined, the templates default language will be used (options: determine the language from the site visitor's browser settings or determine the language from HTML page)

Click `Publish Test Scripts`. Implement the script into the HTML of your staging site.

#### Auto-Blocking 

When the Auto-blocking feature is toggled ON under publication settings, an `optanon...` class is appended to all script tags that store cookies on the browser. The script will only load if the user consent to the cookie category. For example, the following Vimeo script contains the `optanon-category-C0002` class value, meaning the Vimeo script will only load if the user consent to the Performance cookie category: 
`<script src="https://extend.vimeocdn.js" class="optanon-category-C0002">`

To override the `optanon` class and remove the autoblocking feature from certain scripts, the script will need to be removed from the cookie's source on OneTrust:

1. Under Setup > Categorizations > select All Cookies
1. Click on the filter icon > click on Add Filter > click on Add Field: Default Category > select the category from the `optanon` script > click Apply
1. Click into each cookie > click Source
1. Remove the desired script from the cookie's source 
1. Publish the script 


### Do Not Sell & Cookie Setting Button

This will display either `Do Not Sell My Data` button or `Cookie Settings` button based on where the site visitors come from according to the geolocation rule group associated with the domain. The script has a class that can be customized through CSS.

### Cookie List Script

These two methods initialize the OneTrust Publisher SDK. The `initializeOneTrustPublishersSDK` method fetches all of the resources configured in geolocation rules, templates, and vendors. The `loadPreferenceCenter` method is used to load the banner or preference center. By passing in `true`, the preference center will always load. By passing in `false`, the banner will be displayed for initial consent and re-consent.
