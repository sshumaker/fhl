## Speaker list module

This module is for a brief list of speakers as would be seen on a webcast or event. This section requires particular formatting to appear correctly.

![Speaker list](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/speaker-list.jpg)
{:.image-box}

Options

* Speaker List
    * Please add a new bulleted list for each speaker, where each item in the list below is a new bullet point within each list:

```
Bulleted list
  Speaker photo
  Name
  Title
  Company
enter/return enter/return
Bulleted list
  Speaker photo
  Name
  Title
  Company
```

## Flex module

This is a flexible empty box for anything additional that doesn't fit into another module. This could be used to embed an event calendar, more text, a slideshow, whatever you need.

## Trust module

In general it's a good idea to target this messaging subject matter and logos towards your audience.

![Trust module](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/trust.jpg)
{:.image-box}

Options

* Trust copy before
    * This is for specifying the top copy. Default is "Trusted by DevOps Teams and Orgs of All Types".
* Trust images
    * Within this editable area, please insert only logo images, preferably grayscale SVG files using presentation attributes (not style attributes). If you have questions around this, please contact Marketing's Brand and Digital team for assistance.

## Statistics list module

Similar to the bottom section of [this example landing page](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/11/26/migrating-from-jenkins/).

![Statistics list](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/stats-list.jpg)
{:.image-box}

Options

* Stats List
    * This list is designed to feature a set of 3 statistics. That said, it can accommodate larger or smaller lists.
    * Please add a new bulleted list for each stat, where each item in the list below is a new bullet point within each list:

```
Bulleted list
  Logo in color
  Statistic ( 6x, 1000+, < 8 hours ... )
  Description ( faster builds than Jenkins )
enter/return enter/return
Bulleted list
  Logo
  Statistic
  Description
```

## Value box module

This module is meant to explain to individuals that we have more content they might want to look at and it's worth filling out the form.

![Value box](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/value-box-default.jpg)
{:.image-box}

Options

* Value content
    * This option is a fully editable box for copy.
* Value box default image
    * In most cases we want to leave this visible. If we're using custom examples per the below option, we would set this to hidden.
    * Visible
    * Hidden

![Value box](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/value-box.jpg)
{:.image-box}

* Value box examples
    * This box can be used to toggle specific examples of content we want to showcase that are tailored to the audience. In most cases we want this to be hidden and show the default above instead.
    * Hidden
    * Visible
* Value examples
    * This is the editable box where we can set the examples to use.

## Final CTA

Currently we encourage this module to remain off by default. There may be situations where you want to add a CTA outside of the landing page scope such as "Free Trial", "Learn more", or something like that. In that case, you would enable this module's visibility.

![Final CTA](/images/handbook/growth-marketing/marketo-page-template/final-cta.jpg)
{:.image-box}

Options

* Final CTA Section
    * Note that the button styles look like a link when using the editor. Just edit the link URL and text. If you click on the "edit HTML" button you'll see the relevant wrappers and classes which should remain in place.
