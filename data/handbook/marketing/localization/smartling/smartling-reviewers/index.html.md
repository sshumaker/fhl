## Translation Internal Review Process
All Smartling reviewers should be a member of the `#smartling-reviewers` Slack channel. 

To ensure translated content makes contextual and technical sense, we have internal native language speakers review the content. At the moment, our internal reviewers are volunteers. We completely appreciate that this task is on top of your day job and will continue to respect that. Below are some expectations, as we will sometimes have hard deadlines to try to hit.

Internal reviewers **are expected** to review content for accuracy and quality and identify small mistakes made by the translator. Internal reviewers **are not expected** to copyedit or rewrite documents. However, reviewers may want provide preferred translations during the review process and they are welcome to do so. If the quailty of a translated document is poor and needs to be written, the reviewer should stop reading and let the requestor know that the translation is not usable and provide a reason why. The requestor should provide this feedback to the translator.

**Guidelines for reviewers**

1. Identify copy mistakes.
1. Identify areas where the context did not translate well and needs more attention.
1. Identify words or phrases that should **not** be translated.
1. If by the second page it is clear that the translation is too poor to be used, stop reading and let the requestor know that translation is not usable and should be resumbitted.

**Timeframe guideline for reviewers**

1. Stay in communication with the job requester - if you will be delayed reviewing a job please make sure to update the job requester. 
2. If you are tagged in a review issue along with others, please respond ASAP with if you have the bandwidth to take on the job. 
3. If you have claimed a job in Smartling, please complete the review in 5 - 7 business days. Delays are fine, as mentioned above, just stay in communication with the job requester. 
4. If you have trouble with Smartling, please put your question/issue into the slack channel: `#mktgops` and tag the job requester.

## Smartling Reviewer Platform

As you log onto the platform, you will be on your jobs page. There are three important side bars on this page:

- **Current work**: Any work that is actively in review and is assigned to you. 
- **Available to Accept**: This is any work that has reach the internal review step. Here is where content will stay until someone claims the job. 
- **Upcoming**: Any work that is in the editing step of the translation workflow. It could reach the review step in the next day or two. 

Once content is claimed it will populate in Current Work. 

Under current work, reviewers can see the following detail:
- Job Name, and the project it is under (Documents, Marketo, GDN). 
- The progress bar, and the number of words in a job. 

Task due date: The due date for the particular workflow step (ie. the due date for the review to be complete). This is not set up currently so you will not see this populated in the tool. 
Job Due Date: This is the due date for the entire job to be translated.

# Review Mode

Once you click open- it will go into Review mode, which gives you an option to see this bi lingual or mono lingual. Here you will see the visual context of the content- eg if you are translating an email in Marketo , you should be able to see the email design. 

You are able to reject/ approve strings in the review made. 

If you wish to make changes to the content yourself -  then please switch to the CAT tool at the top of the page. 

# CAT Tool

Here the following tabs are available:

- **Job Briefing**: This holds Gitlab content style guide and any additional attachments to the job. 
- **Context**: If you job has come from the Marketo or GDN page, it will here show you the webpage/email/etc. so you have context to the translation. 
- **Quality Insurance**: This will show any potential errors including spellings, translation errors, spacing, etc. 
- **Translation Memory**: automatically populated. The percentages indicated whether there is memory match. You can search the translation memory for words/phrases and inserted them into translation using the “Insert TM” button.
- **Glossary** : reviewers are able to search the glossary. These should be applied by the time content has reached the review step - although the glossary term may be a “do not translate” term. 

On the right hand column in the CAT tool, there are some more information like

- **Quality assurance report**: Takes into account 100 data points to score the quality of the translation. 70 or higher is a good point of quality. You can download this report at the top of the page and slice the data as you wish. 
- **Issues**: This is a way for you to communicate directly with the linguist who translated the job and Any existing issues that have been raised will be available in this tab.

If you have an issue with a particular string, then click into the string, then on the right hand side, open a review Issue. This will open up a pop up that will allow you to define the description of issue and the following:

Issue Type: Source (Marketo, Document, GDN) OR Translation (Translation issues are comments, questions or queries in relation to the translation submitted for a source string. ) 

Once you are done, you can submit the job at the top of the page and the job will be published.
