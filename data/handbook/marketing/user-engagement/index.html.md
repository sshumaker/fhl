title: User Engagement
description: >-
  User Engagement is one of GitLab's top 12 cross-functional initiatives. The goal is to strengthen our developer brand and increase contributors per month to GitLab.
---

User community engagement is important in creating awareness among various communities who become advocates of GitLab internally at companies down the line or influence others at said companies. Improving our user engagement is one of GitLab's top 12 cross-functional intiatives. The goal is to have a strong developer brand.

The User Engagement initiative has three workstreams:
1. Build brand awareness with thought leadership and technical content to activate members of our community programs (Education, Open Source, Meetups, Heroes) (# active community members).
  * [Public technical content epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1795)
1. Develop, brand and market the DevOps Architect Certification program focused on technical users at our customers and our partners (# of partner and total certifications).
  * [Public certification epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/-/epics/1277)
1. Drive toward 1000 contributors a month using a marketing funnel approach.
  * [Public contributor goal epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1796)

*Note: In addition to the public epics above, there are placeholder epics in the confidential top 12 initiatives repository. As our work on this initiative does not require confidentiality, we are not linking to those placeholders.*

## Overall Goal
Activate the community and drive them to become more involved in GitLab programs - community programs, certification or contributor programs. Increase contributors to 1000 contributors per month.
