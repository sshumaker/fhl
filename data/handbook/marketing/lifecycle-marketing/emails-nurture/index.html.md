## Overview
{: #overview .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

This page focuses on emails and nurture programs, owned and managed by Lifecycle Marketing, Marketing Campaigns, and Marketing Operations. The Campaigns Team is heavily focused on driving leads from Unknown > Inquiry > SAO, leveraging an "always on", logic-based and persona-driven nurture engine.

*The [Intelligent Email Nurture](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#intelligent-email-nurture) (launched 2021-12-17) aims at progressing leads from INQ > SAO, and leverages segment/region data to provide the *right offer* to the *right person* at the *right time* - based on their segment, region, and placement in the buyer journey (lead funnel), with persona-focus as a second iteration.*

**Related Handbook: [Email Management](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/email-management/)**

**Key foundational elements to achieve this:**
* A strategically segmented Marketo database
    - this is an ongoing effort led by MOps in collaboration with Campaigns
    - *please see [note below regarding segmentation and email requests](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#one-time-emails)*
    - [see the overall database segmentation epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1331)
    - [see this epic for more campaign-based tactical segmentations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1467)
* A persona-based prescriptive buyer journey
    - this is an ongoing effort led by Campaigns in collaboration with Content Mktg, Product Mktg, Technical Mktg
    - [see the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1530)
* Logic-based Marketo nurture programs by segment
    - this is an ongoing effort led by Campaigns, and specifically spearheded by our Email Marketing Campaign Manager [@Aklatzkin](https://gitlab.com/Aklatzkin).
    - [see this epic for holding location of projects to be prioritized](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/1040)

## GitLab Email Calendar
{: #calendar .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
We have moved our email calendar to Asana! We will have email stakeholder syncs each Thursday to review emails for the upcoming two weeks. If you need the call added to your calendar, please ask Allie Klatzkin. To ensure this is done smoothly, please add your emails to the calendar as soon as you know that they are upcoming (regardless if you have all information). Due to limited seats, we will be providing 1-2 seats per team on the calendar. Please reach out to your team's DRI with any questions. 

**Calendar goal**
* Prioritize our emails to ensure we are sending the right emails to the right audience at the right time.
* Provide visibility across teams on upcoming sends
* Streamline communication and processes around emails

**Process to add emails to the calendar:**

[Email issue templates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/#request-issue-templates), in Campaigns, Marketing Ops, Corporate Marketing, and Field Marketing projects, will have the ~email-calendar label on them which will automatically add emails to the calendar. If your issue does not have the ~email-calendar label, please add it to ensure visibility for the calendar. 

Steps to add to the Asana calendar:
* Ensure the label for "email-calendar" is added to your issue.
* Add labels for the appropriate segmentation: “Global-email”, “EMEA-email”, “AMER-email”, “APAC-email”
* Add labels for appropriate email type: “operational-email” “non-operational-email”  
* Set email issue due date as the send date



### Holiday coverage for severity::1 security vulnerabilities email communication
{: #holiday-coverage}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In the event of an severity::1 (critical) security vulnerability email communication is needed during the holidays, please create an issue using the *[incident_communications](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new#incident_communications)* template and ping in [#marketing_programs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CCWUCP4MS) tagging @marketing-programs and #mktgops. Follow  addititonal directions [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#pagerduty-and-emergency-comms). 


## QA process
{: #qa-processes .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**FY23-Q4**: Lifecycle Marketing will be running a Q4 trial of reviewing **all** emails prior to send to ensure compliance with email best practices. Team members are responsible fo reviewing and optimizing their own emails, following the latest [email best practices from lifecycle marketing](handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#best-practices). Lifecycle will be partnering will email stakeholders to improve email performance and drive the best results for our campaigns, as well as maintain brand consistency across all email touchpoints.

**FY24-Q1**: In Q1 of FY24, we will share out how we will continue to scale the email review process.

Email workflow:
First step in requesting an email from lifecycle begins by creating an issue using the appropriate [issue template](handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/#request-issue-templates) in GitLab.

### Team variations to QA process
{: #qa-processes-by-team}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
- Campaigns: build the email yourself (or request from Verticurl) and have lifecycle QA.
- FMM: Request the email to be built by Verticurl and send to lifecycle for approval.
- Corp: using the process we outlined previously [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aTCrUlc87BDLAqqAju7ZEbL8Wu0VZNfWd1MhdAccRDA/edit#gid=0)

#### Campaigns Team QA process
{: #qa-process-campaigns}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
_Submit final email for QA and scheduling_

- Step 1: Submit an email issue for the appropriate email type and assign yourself and a lifecycle counterpart to your email. Be sure to include the proper labels for the email calendar.
- Step 2: Highlight your desired send date and time. (Will be reviewed and potentially modified by the Lifecycle team).
- Step 3: Build the program and email in Marketo by referring to our [email marketing best practices](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j6F-3ZOFtFM9Tjz1srzbqLjSA56sK7lR2LPdKSl57Vo/edit?usp=sharing) and segment the email accordingly.
- Step 4: Include a link to the Marketo program while submitting an [Email issue request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-email).
- Step 5: Send a sample for lifecycle to QA
    - Global/AMER/Newsletters/Corporate = reviewed by [Allie](mailto:aklatzkin@gitlab.com)
    - APAC/EMEA/Intelligent Nurture = reviewed by [Luis](mailto:ldambrosio@gitlab.com)
- Step 6: Make revisions & schedule the email. Can be done by lifecycle or campaigns team member.

#### Field Marketing QA process
{: #qa-process-field-marketing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
_Request for Verticurl to build the email_
- Step 1: Submit an email issue as normal with requested send time and date. Assign to lifecycle marketing for advanced visibility.
- Step 2: Create copy and tag Verticurl and Lifecycle - within existing SLA of 5 days before send:
    - [Copy doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZhHihX1tSoMkio2-qN-iH7lX_2WQuudVOBacd5tiHIk/edit?usp=sharing) filled in (including UTMs - only necessary for internal links)
    - Images 
    - Requested segmentation
- Step 3: Verticurl will build the email and send to FMM & Lifecycle to review within 24 hours
- Step 4: Verticurl makes any corrections and will schedule the email

#### Corporate Marketing QA process
{: #qa-process-corporate}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
_Request for Lifecycle to determine promotional content_

Upon request, we will work with the Corporate Events team to promote and follow-up from our sponsored corporate conferences.

Promotion will only be done for Tier 1 events and events that have ancillary events added to them. We will promote to audiences who have previously attended the event, in addition to local audiences that match the persona. For full criteria and steps, please see [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aTCrUlc87BDLAqqAju7ZEbL8Wu0VZNfWd1MhdAccRDA/edit?usp=sharing). 

The process must kick off a month before the event, to ensure we have all of the relevant information for promotion and follow-up.

#### Newsletter QA process
{: #qa-process-newsletter}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Labels for Intelligent Nurture Progress
{: #intelligent-nurture-labels}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

We created several GitLab labels for a better organization of each asset that we are adding to the intelligent nurture.

Below we explain the labels created and what each one is for:

* [intel-nurture](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=intel-nurture&first_page_size=20): This label is global and will help us identify that the issue we are working on is directly for the intelligent nurture. All "add to intelligent nurture" issues must have this label, and it is included in the issue template.
* [intel-nurture::write-copy](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=intel-nurture%3A%3Awrite-copy&first_page_size=20): This label helps us know that the issue is in the process of email copy development. We cannot move on to the next step (email-build) until the copy is final.
* [intel-nurture::email-build](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=intel-nurture%3A%3Aemail-build&first_page_size=20): This label helps us to know that the email is in production. Verticurl is responsible for building the emails.
* [intel-nurture::email-test](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=intel-nurture%3A%3Aemail-test&first_page_size=20): This label tells us that the email has already been built and that the Verticurl team has sent tests to both the requesters AND the lifecycle marketing team for review. In this step we check that the links work correctly, that the content of the email is correct and that the correct utm values are used for appropriate tracking of the links. Once the email is approved, we proceed to the last step.
* [intel-nurture::add-to-streams](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/?sort=due_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=intel-nurture%3A%3Aadd-to-streams&first_page_size=20): This label helps us to identify that the issue is in its final stage where we proceed to add the email to the relevant nurture streams.
   - **PLEASE NOTE: the requester indicates the desired streams in the description of the issue, but the Lifecycle Marketing team makes the final decision on which streams are relevant. Please reference [the stream alignment rules](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#nurture-stream-offer-alignment) for what content type is relevant for each stream.**

### Intelligent Nurture Processes
{: #intelligent-nurture-processes}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Creating a nurture email program for the Intelligent Nurture
{: #create-nurture-email}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**The following process is the technical process for creating a new email send program that is then activated in the appropriate streams/channels of the Intelligent Nurture. The project management process is integrated into the epic/issue creation for our core tactics that would be dropped into the nurture (new content, webcasts, workshops, analyst reports).

1. In Marketo, [Clone this template](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/PG8466A1)
    - Clone into `A Campaign Folder`
    - Name the program with the following format: `Type-ShortContentName` (i.e. `ebook-scaledci` or `webcast-simlifycicd` or `wrkshp-security`)
    - Choose the folder: `Master Email Programs (Intelligent Nurture)`
1. Edit the email in the program
    - DO NOT UPDATE THE EMAIL CODE or you will break the email from the template.
    - Copy is indicated in the issue and should align to the email template.
    - If the email copy is missing an element (i.e. the CTA button is missing, or the subheader is not supplied), please comment in the issue to remind the copywriter of the template to follow.
1. Add the link to the new email in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QRilUEUGSUlMwwsMa_G11HRmxSskHFgDeWV0STOtLh4/edit#gid=2096477155) in the column named: `Link to New Marketo Program`
    - If the content/webcast/offer is not listed, create a new row and fill out accordingly, making sure to note the UTM parameters (which are critical to proper reporting) and the Pathfactory URL.

#### Adding a nurture email program to Intelligent Nurture programs/streams
{: #add-nurture-email}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

After you have created the Email Program (see above: [Creating a nurture email program for the Intelligent Nurture](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#create-nurture-email)) and tested your email (including checking UTM parameters), your email is ready to be activated in the Intelligent Nurture.

Work with the Campaigns Team to indicate the appropriate streams for the offer to be included (this is based on segment/region/funnel stage).

1. Navigate to the appropiate nurture program (i.e. AMER Enterprise)
1. In the appropriate stream (i.e. MQL > SAO), click the plus icon at the top.
1. Inn the `Type` section, select `Program`
1. In the `Program Name` section, begin to type in the name of the corresponding email program (i.e. ebook-10stepsciso) and select the program you created for this offer
1. In the `Smart Campaign` section, select `01 Send Controller`
1. Now, click the gear icon for your program in the stream and either:
   - `Activate` if it is not an upcoming event
   - `Edit Availability` if it is an upcoming event and set the "End Date" for the date of the event. This will automatically stop the email from sending when the event has taken place.

#### Alignment of Offer Types (CTAs) in Intelligent Nurture Streams
{: #nurture-stream-offer-alignment}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

The following is where different offer types should align in the email nurture streams. This is based on the essence of the offers, and the maturity of the person in terms of education about GitLab (i.e. advanced workshops are **not** a fit for RAW > INQ stream as these are leads who have taken no prior action with GitLab and should be receiving top funnel content).

[SEE THIS DIAGRAM FOR WHERE CONTENT IS FIT FOR THE INTELLIGENT NURTURE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j6F-3ZOFtFM9Tjz1srzbqLjSA56sK7lR2LPdKSl57Vo/edit#slide=id.g165f27d5f94_0_10)

#### Adding an A/B test to Intelligent Nurture
{: #ab-test-nurture}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Because our intelligent nurture is setup calling to programs, we cannot use Marketo's Champion/Challenger to A/B test emails. 

Instead, we should take the following steps:
1. Build a second email and create a description of what was changed in the name i.e "Subject line test version" (or even saying the test)
2. Add it as a random sample in the send controller as shown in the flow below (use 50% for 2 versions, or split between 100% for more versions):


    ![email-ab-test](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/image-4.png){: .medium.center}
    
3. Monitor results on an email report
4. Document results on [A/B testing tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BaGJbiYIG8187nnXXy2tvNtJyKXLV4CenCAZMYJbmeI/edit#gid=2079991889)

Please see the [A/B testing section](/handbook/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/emails-nurture/#best-practices-testing) below for best practices for conducting an A/B test.


#### Intelligent Nurture - Event promotional changes 2022-2023
{: #event-promotional-changes-2022}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In an effort to ensure audiences are not receiving duplicate emails and to streamline our own processes, we will be updating our current approach for promoting events via Intelligent Nurture and 2 email blasts. For now, all add to nurture issues that have duplicate email blasts will be cancelled. We will roll out a more comprehensive process in February.

For additional context, please see the [issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/3111).

### Marketo Email Journey
{: #email-journey}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
What happens to Marketo when a contact is a member of a program equal to True.
Marketo within the engagement programs will try to send the number 1 email of the stream. If the contact does not comply with the requirements, Marketo will try to send the mail number 2 and so on until only 2 things happen: 1 – that the mail is sent or 2 – that no mail is sent from the stream and the contact becomes exhausted.
In the image below there is an explicit way on how Marketo “plays” with the send controller of 2 different emails on the same day.
![Marketo-Journey](/uploads/668ae822065318dc3ebc6c8910a70a77/Screen_Shot_2022-04-28_at_8.56.57_AM.png)
The ONLY way for a contact to advance from one stream to another is when it generates enough interaction and its scoring increases enough to move it from RAW to INQ from INQ to MQL or from MQL to SAO.
 
Also the only way for a contact who already has exhausted status to change status is to continue adding new content in the streams.
 
Which would lead us to the next solution. Once the contacts fall into exhausted status they should be moved to a list of "Non-Responders" and then moved to a specific Nurture to increase interaction with the company.


#### Trial nurture
{: #nurture-trial}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* **Goal:** Educate trialers about key features to use during 30 day period.
* **Delivery System:** Marketo (and Outreach sequences by SDRs)
* **Trial Key Email:** the self-managed trial sign-up triggers a unique trial key email confirmation before launching the 30 day email series.

#### In Product Email Campaigns
{: #in-product-emails .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
**Sent through Mailgun**  
These emails are sent “from the product” meaning the growth engineers build the emails in the product and use Mailgun as the SMTP. All of these emails are tagged “marketing” in Mailgun so when you view analytics, it’s an aggregate look for all of these emails. There is also a Mailgun unsubscribe link. All of this data lives in Mailgun. 
To see all the emails,  [click here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/growth/-/epics/62#note_494532868)

To see slide deck, [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QSlbq-ZlMijqaSBA1l29WIn06Z8OAYAgX9_g9CQu3B4/edit#slide=id.g540caf0310_0_0)

**These are also known as:**
- User onboarding emails
- Free user nurture
- User nurture
- User emails
- Any sort of combination of the above

**We launched these for:**  
- Free SaaS users - Beginning of Feb, 2021
- Free Self-managed users - Launching mid-late may, 2021

**Iterations:**  
We changed send time from 9am UTC every day (5am on the US east coast, 2am pacific) to 4PM UTC. This Change went live April 29, 2021. We could use April 30th forward for a comparison.

**Who’s part of this project?**  
- Allie Klatzkin (replaced Nout Boctor-Smith) - email marketing DRI, mailgun analytics, & assist technical setup
- Sam Awezec (Growth)
- Gayle Doud (Growth)
- Growth engineers - technical setup

**So what’s the deal?**  
Basically, we have a series of emails that deploy to net new namespaces. The goal is to get free users to use features of the product. There are 4 tracks - adopt Create, adopt Verify, invite Team, try a Trial. Each track has 3 emails that try to nudge users to take action. If a user takes the action referenced in the email, they will not get the next email in the series.

**Keep in mind that:**  
- only 50% namespaces get enrolled (control vs experiment)
- sub-groups are excluded
- the tracking of this data only started a few weeks ago (April 2021)
- we only send emails if they have not fulfilled the previous action. For invite it would be if they have started a trial

**Sisense data**  
- [Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/820093/WIP:-Onboarding-Emails)
- Control = not getting the email, candidate = getting the emails


**From email and reply-to email**  
`team @ gitlab.com` -  which is a group inbox. Amy is also a member of this group inbox.
**HTML files**  
All of the HTML email files are in [Litmus](https://litmus.com/folders/14964).

**For more in-depth information about how these emails are implemented, please view the [project epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/growth/-/epics/62) and all associated project issues.**

## Ad-hoc (one-time) emails
{: #one-time-emails .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Important note regarding audience segmentation efforts and efficiency
{: #note-audience-segmentation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Until our foundational Marketo database segmentations (noted in the overview at the top of this handbook page) are rolled out, there are challenges in targeting audiences efficiencly. If you would like to propose an MVC email, please remember that the tactical execution may be beyond bandwidth constraints.

### Steps to set up and edit emails
{: #setting-up-emails}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

For one-time emails (i.e. a blast to promote a program for which we do not receive leads):
1. DEPENDENCY: target list issue must be complete before email can be sent (15 business day SLA to create target list)
2. Clone [this Marketo email send template](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/EBP7320A1)
    - Clone to: `A campaign folder`
    - Folder: `Ad-hoc (one time) emails`
    - Name: follow format of `YYYYMMDD_NameOfEmail` where YYYYMMDD is date of send (i.e. 20210603_DORAsurvey)
    - Description: Link to GitLab email issue
3. Update email in the send program
4. Update utm_campaign in Marketo **My Tokens** for email send

* [Video on how to create an email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfl71Hh5e2E)
* [Video on how to edit an email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUvykCohLqI)

### (Interim) target list creation
{: #target-lists}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
Target list issue templates are an interim solution while foundational work is being complete for overall [Marketo database audience stretegy for lifecycle marketing engine](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/2022) (DRI: Nout Boctor-Smith).

* **Lifecycle Stage (Lead Status):** Raw, Inquiry, Nurture, MQL, Accepted, Qualifying, Qualified
* **Sales Segment:** add filter for `sales segment` Marketo segment
* **Region:** add filter for `region` Marketo segment
* **Sub-Region:** add filter for `sub-region` Marketo segment
* **Sales Territory (if specific):** ??
* **Key Persona:** ??
* **Activity filters:** ??
* **Inclusions:** ??
* **Exclusions:** ??

**What to do with DemandBase Lists:** In the Marketo smartlist, add filter for either `Account ID (18) ` or `Email Address` (depending on what is provided in the DemandBase target list export that the requester has submited) and paste the list of Account IDs or Email Address from the DemandBase target list export.

### Active lists 
{: #Active-Lists}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
To assist in building email target lists, MktgOps has developed a series of Marketo smart lists that can be used to determine how active a lead is based on specific time increments. Call on these smart lists to get the most up to date active user list for your email sends. The smart lists are located in the Database section of Marketo. They are:

* [01 Active List 30 days](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52980708A1)
* [02 Active List 60 days](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52980709A1)
* [03 Active List 90 days](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52980710A1)
* [04 Active List 6 months days](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52979300A1)
* [05 Active List 12 months](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52980711A1)
* [06 Active List 18 months](https://engage-ab.marketo.com/?munchkinId=194-VVC-221#/classic/SL52980712A1)

#### Email Request Issue Template
{: #email-request-issue}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

**PLEASE READ IMPORTANT NOTE IN SECTION ABOVE PRIOR TO SUBMITTING**

To request an email send, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=request-email) for consideration of your MVC email idea, and provide as much detail as possible (especially around the audience), and please respect if the determination is that "the juice isn't worth the squeeze" and that we may want to delay the launch until some foundational audience segmentations are established. Please review the `Email Review Protocol` section below for more detail.

**SLA:** There is a standard 5 Business Day SLA in place for new email requests. All details in the "Submitter Checklist" of the issue must be complete in order to be triaged to the appropriate Campaign Manager and/or Lifecycle Marketing Manager.

**Assign issues to:** You must assign issues to the corresponding Lifecycle Marketing Manager for review before send.
* `@aklatzkin`: Global, AMER, Corporate Events, Newsletters
* `@dambrold`: APAC, EMEA, Intelligent Nurture

**Add the issue to the Asana email calendar:** By default, issues will add the label for ~"email-calendar", you will need to add the label for your audience as well:
* ~"Global-emails"
* ~"AMER-emails"
* ~"APAC-emails"
* ~"EMEA-emails"

**Urgent security emails are exempt from this SLA.*

All links in email sends, going to about.gitlab.com will need to be appended with utm parameters, following the nomenclature outlined in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jm8q13e3-JNDbJ5-DBJbSAGprLamrilWIBka875gDI/edit#gid=0). This is the way we track and give attribution to emails.

#### Need-to-know details for the email request
{: #email-request-details}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Below are the information from the issue template that will need to be filled out before the Campaign Manager will create the email in the appropriate system:

- **Sender Name**: Typically we use GitLab Team for most outgoing communications; for Security Alerts we use GitLab Security. Choosing a name that is consistent with the type and/or content of email being sent is important, if unsure make a note and we will make recommendation.
- **Sender Email Address**: What email address should be used? Default is info@gitlab.com
- **Approvers**: All approvers must be listed on the email request. At least one individual who will receive the replies to the email must be listed an as approver. For example, if the email is coming from security@, someone who will receive replies to the email should be listed as one of the approvers. See approval table below.
- **Subject Line**: 50 character max is preferred (30-40 characters for mobile devices)
- **Email Body Copy**: Can be a text snippet within issue, clearly identified comment on issue or attach a Google Doc with copy. The copy must be approved before requesting the email.
- **Target Date to Send Email**: at a minimum a few days notice is preferred because we need to balancing the number of emails being sent to our database so they are not perceived (or marked) as spam; however, a simple email can be turned in a few hours if absolutely necessary
- **Recipient List**: Emails can be sent to one of the [existing segments](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo#geographic-dma-list ) or a recipient list can be provided as a .csv file
    -  Audience should be appropriately segmented and tokens selected for personalization (if applicable)
    -  All subscribers are selected list are opted-in to receive your message
    -  If supplying a .csv file, the file must include the following fields:  Email address, First Name (or Full Name)
    -  If personalizing the email to reference a specific project or page, that field must be included in the .csv file and clearly marked using the same terminology used in the email copy. The email copy must clearly identify {{Project}}or {{Page}}where the applicable personalization should be inserted.

#### Types of email requests
{: #email-request-types}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

## Email marketing best practices
{: #best-practices .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

** Please see our most up to date email best practices in our guide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j6F-3ZOFtFM9Tjz1srzbqLjSA56sK7lR2LPdKSl57Vo/edit?usp=sharing). ** 

### Subject line best practices (and preview text)
{: #best-practices-subject-lines}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* Use subject lines to justify sending the email and connecting to a problem that the reader might have
* Ask yourself "why would I open this email"? - include the **value proposition**
* Keep it short and sweet - only include that is absolutely necessary
* Try 28 to 39 characters - studies suggest this is a "sweet spot" but that is always debatable and testable 
* Front-load - put information information **first**
* Be specific - emphasize what the reader "gets" out of reading this email
* Test when you can!
* Chad White, email marketing strategist and book author created the **CUE-DIVE method**:
   * ❏ Contextual - personalized, localized, segmented, relevant, anticipated
   * ❏ Urgent - topical, events, deadlines, newsjacking
   * ❏ Emotional - aspirations, happiness, anxiety, duty, fear
   * ❏ Detailed - answers the question “what is this email about?”
   * ❏ Intriguing - questions, curiosity, mysterious, humor, puns
   * ❏ Visual - very long or very short, unusual spelling, emojis, unusual punctuation
   * ❏ Earned - testimonials, reviews, endorsements, media coverage
* SUBJECT LINES AFFECT OTHER METRICS TOO! Subject lines affect click through rates & conversions! Poor subject lines can damage the performance of future email campaigns. Do not underestimate their importance!
* The preview text is the first sentence displayed in an email client alongside the subject line (before opening the email), don't ignore it! Some email clients show 90 characters, so there is some flexibility with length

### Email content best practices
{: #best-practices-content}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

* Email copy should be clear and concise. Brevity is key. Think about conversion, not sharing every detail from the LP
* Focus on value-first content and CTAs. Ask yourself: "what's in it for the subscriber?"
* Avoid walls of text when possible - think facts, not fluff
* Lead with benefits and add details where appropriate
* Use extremely clear wording and remove words that don't provide value
* 1-2 CTAs per email is best practice (calls-to-action)
* Take advantage of content hierarchy
* Write for people not technology, this means you can use humor when it makes sense
* Buttons should be no longer than 25 characters - 14 characters as a standard

* Make sure that the size of your HTML file does not exceed 102kb, otherwise gmail will truncate your email and your email will be out of compliance.
* If linking to the GitLab marketing site, make sure that the URL has a slash at the end of the link. Marketing site pages will not render if there are URL params and there is no trailing slash.

### Design best practices
{: #best-practices-design}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

*  Consider resposive design
*  Code all text in HTML
*  Minimize CTAs
*  Images should add to the goal of your email and not take away from it
*  An email is not a landing page
*  Consider accessibility

### A/B testing best practices
{: #best-practices-testing}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Add your tests to the [A/B testing tracker here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-XQjw1A_m5N4NaW6Er2TUlMeWPS-vTPJ2cDE9ddFLpg/edit?usp=sharing)

*  Each test group should include at least 1000 people
*  You need a bigger test group if you're testing for click-through rate versus testing for open rate
*  Have a goal and idea regarding what you want to improve and how your test is going to help with that
*  Test _one_ variable at a time
*  Due to our small sample sizes, we recommend a full 50/50 split versus a 10/10/80 or 20/20/60 split
*  Remember your subject line or "from name" (testing open rates) could have an impact on click-through rate and conversion rate
*  Let the Campaign Manager know at the beginning of the project if you're interested in running an A/B test and what your goals/hypothesis is
*  Keep track of the split test learnings so we can learn and innovate!

### Email KPI's that matters
{: #email-kpis-that-matters}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

To view current benchmarks in Marketo, go to the [Email Insights Tab](https://ab-ee-api.marketo.com/).

**Delivery Rate:**

Our delivery rate should be in the high 90s.  Anything below this number needs to be addressed. A low delivery rate could be indicative of two things: poor list quality or the wrong email service provider.

How is the delivery rate calculated? Number of emails delivered divided by number of emails sent.

Example: 950/1000 = 95% Delivery Rate.

**Open Rate:**

Our email open rate is directly tied to our subject line and possibly our subheader. What is considered a good open rate will vary by industry, but on average, a healthy open rate may be anywhere between 15%-25%.

If our open rate is low, consider testing different subject lines or preheaders to see what style works best with our customers.
How is the open rate calculated? Number of emails opened divided by the number of emails delivered.

Example: 200/1000 = 20% Open Rate

**Click To Open Rate:**

There are several factors which could go into a low click-to-open rate, such as our email design, our content, our call to action — really any element in the body of our email.
 
It is a little more challenging to isolate what may be causing a low click-to-open rate, which is why we need to set up some A/B test splits to determine the cause.
 
How to calculate the Click To Open Rate: Unique Clicks divided by number of emails open.

Example: 50/200 = 25%

**Opt-Out Rate:**

Generally a good (low) unsubscribe (or opt-out rate) is below 0.2%. But anything above 1% is a problem. Determining why customers are opting out can be a challenge, so be proactive. Set up a brief survey for people who do opt out asking why.

How is the Opt-out rate calculated? Total Opt-outs divided by the number of emails delivered.

Example: 5/950 = 0.5% Unsubscribe Rate.

## Email Templates
{: #email-templates .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

#### Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/demand-generation/campaigns/-/issues/3375) for more details and to see how the email templates look.

**What are email templates?** An email template is a reusable HTML file that is used to build email campaigns (according to Litmus).

**Why are email templates important?** Using an email template allows you to produce campaigns faster, since the underlying code is already written. Instead of having to rewrite an entire email from scratch for every send, you can simply add copy, images, and links to an existing template before testing and sending it to your subscribers (according to Litmus).

**What email templates are available for us to use?** In Marketo (Design Studio > Email Templates), the following email templates are available:

| Template Name in MKTO | Use For | Image Specs | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| A - Event Invite v3.0  | Events or asset downloads | Background image - Transparent background 600px wide |  Top button is removable, **The text version will need to be updated manually due to limitations with marketo variables** |
| B - Advanced modular template - light mode | Larger events/assets with more modules to add with speakers; Transparent background 600 px wide, Speaker images - 300px wide  | Do not use all modules at once, **The text version will need to be updated manually due to limitations with marketo variables** |
| C - Simple email template | Assets/webcasts/events/anything | Background image - png 600x wide. Transparent background | Only use with 1 CTA |
| D - Letter format v1.0 | Any letter-like communication such as account update | N/A | N/A |
| E - Newsletter Dark Mode | DevOps Download developer newsletter only | The only image we swap out is the background image of the release section - 600px wide. The top image (infinity loop) is 600px wide also. | For DevOps Download newsletter only|
| F - Level Up Certification Invite Template | Level-up certification content | TBD | N/A |
| G - Event Invite with 2 buttons| Webcast invitations, events, ABM, anything really | Headline background image - 600px wide; Speaker images - 300px wide | **The text version will need to be updated manually due to limitations with marketo variables** |
| H - Advanced modular template | Larger events/assets with more modules to add with speakers; Transparent background 600 px wide, Speaker images - 300px wide  | Do not use all modules at once, **The text version will need to be updated manually due to limitations with marketo variables** |

**Additional links/info:**
- A - Event Invite v2.0 -- [COPY DOC TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j43mf7Lsq2AXoNwiygGAr_laiFzmokNCfMHi7KNLjuA/edit#heading=h.tl82wncgutxu)

- Event invites or reminders - please use "Event Invite 2 buttons and speakers v1.0"
- Privacy policy updates, account updates, or text-heavy emails - please use "Letter format v1.0"

If you don't have Marketo access and would like to see what the email templates look like, [please view the project Epic and corresponding issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/759).

**NOTE:** It is very important that you format your copy to align with the design of the email template you're using. This will improve efficiency of building emails, and ensure copy is best fit to the layout.

**What if I want a custom email template?** You may submit a request for a custom layout, but please note that the critical priority currently is to efficiently launch emails and nurtures into market. In your [request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/lifecycle-marketing/-/issues/new), please tag @nbsmith and clearly describe why the existing layout is not satisfactory, how often and broadly the requested template will be used, and quantifiable benefits we anticipate from the new layout. To reiterate: Upon implementation of the critical emails and nurtures, we plan to devote more time and energy to developing and testing new templates, however the launch of lifecycle emails takes precedence over these requests.


## Email review protocol
{: #review-protocol .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

All Campaign Managers and reviewers should adhere to the following protocol for every marketing email that is sent to ensure brand consistency and quality in our email program. While the owner of the email should review the email, they must also assign the emails to the corresponding Lifecycle Marketing Manager as listed on the email templates.


We use both Marketo and MailJet to send ad-hoc emails. Marketo is the primary system for all marketing emails and the regularly scheduled security updates. MailJet should be used for emails to gitlab.com users as these users are not in our marketing systems (unless they have signed up for content). *Examples of emails to be sent through MailJet: Critical security updates, support updates that impact a specific subset of users, suspicious account activity notifications.*

To send via MailJet, fill out an issue and follow protocol found [here](/handbook/marketing/emergency-response/#customer-comms-email).

## Sales nominated flows in Marketo
{: #sales-nominated .gitlab-purple}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

In some cases, when invitations need to be more specific for an event, the Sales Nominated flows are used to allow sales to nominate who will receive the invite.

Note: if someone is nominated, but is unmailable (due to unsubscribe, invalid email, or hard bounce), they will not receive the invitation.

### Activating the sales nominated flow in Marketo
{: #sales-nominated-activation}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->

Sales Nominated automation smart lists are applied to Marketo program templates where sales nominated flows are relevant.

**Review the Email**:

Send sample to the DRI for the program (i.e. workshop owner) who is responsible for testing and QAing the email. The email can be found under the `Assets` folder in the program. For some programs, the Marketo My Tokens are included in the Sales Nominated invite to make the email setup more efficient.

**Review the smartlist and schedule recurrence of email:**
* Smart List (filter):
    - Member of Program: (current program, registered status)
    - Not Was Sent Email: (one of previous emails for this event) in last 7 days
    - Subscription Filters (fitlers here are dependent on program type, and subject to change, so not adding all details)
* Flow
    - Send email: sales nominated email in the program
* Schedule
    - Choose `Schedule Recurrence`
    - Schedule: Daily
    - First Run: next relevant day to send (i.e. next business day available). Choose time of day relevant for timezone of event.
    - Repeat Every: Weekday (M-F)
    - End On: Day of the event

## Adding “add to calendar” links in our emails without using 3rd party tools
{: #email-add-to-calendar}
<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS ANCHOR -->
Example:

[Add to google calendar](https://gitlab.com/) | [Add to other calendar](https://gitlab.com/)

**Note:** gmail inboxes a majority of our sends, according to litmus analytics pixel data. Outlook makes up 3-15% of our recipients. This is exactly what Limus did:

It’s virtually impossible to support all the calendar applications available. To help us understand what calendar tools to focus on, we took a look at our Email Analytics data. The most popular email clients our subscribers use are Apple Mail, Gmail, and Outlook. Using this data, we focused our efforts on creating a “add to calendar” button that would be compatible with iCalendar, Google’s calendar, and Outlook’s calendar.
