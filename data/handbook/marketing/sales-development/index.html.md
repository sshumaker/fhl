As a Sales Development Representative (SDR) or Business Development Representative (BDR) in the Sales Development Organization you need to have an understanding of not only product and industry knowledge, but also sales soft skills, and internal [tools](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-development-tools/) and processes. This handbook page will act as a guide to those topics as well as general information about the Sales Development Organization.

#### Onboarding
In your first month at GitLab we want to help ensure you have everything you need to be successful in your job. You will go through enablement videos, live sessions, and activities covering a wide range of getting started topics.
- [BDR/SDR onboarding goals and process](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sdr-playbook-onboarding/)

#### Sales Development Org Enablement

The Sales Development Organization will conduct enablement and training on a wide range of topics such as workflow/processes, campaigns, alignment with other teams, tool training, product training, etc. BDR/SDR enablement sessions are scheduled on an as needed basis and will be made available for BDR/SDR teams to consume asynchronously.

To view previously recorded BDR/SDR Enablement content, you can view the [BDR/SDR Enablement Video Library here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrjbznnEEiCtxUfT8-OV6X8)

- If you would like to request or run an enablement session on a specific topic, please fill out [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new?issuable_template=sdr_enablement_series_request).

#### Sales Development Technical Development
As part of your [onboarding](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sdr-playbook-onboarding/), you will begin an Sales Development Technical Development course with our Senior Sales Dev Enablement Manager.

## Other Helpful definitions

**Hyper-personalization** - This is the concept of combining real-time data extracted from multiple sources to create outreach that resonates with prospects on an individual level. The desired outcome is to establish relevance with a prospect as a first step towards a conversation.

**VIP (prospect)** - A Very important top officer, executive buyer, C-level prospect, or important influencer. For these individuals, hyper-personalization is required. Examples: CTO, CIO, CSIO, C-level, IT Business unit leads, VPs, strategic project leaders.

**Influencer (prospect)** - An individual prospect that is suspected to be involved with IT decision-making, tooling, teams, roadmap, strategic projects, and/or budgets. Examples: Director or Manager of DevOps / Engineering / Cloud / Security, Enterprise Architects, IT buyers, SysAdmins, purchasing managers, and product owners.

**User (prospect)** - A prospect that has limited influence within an IT organization. Examples: Developers, Engineers, QA, consultants, and business users.

**Groundswell** - An outbound strategy focused on filling the top of the funnel by generating engagement, opt-ins, MQLs, and uncovering intent signals. This strategy typically incorporates more automation than other more direct outbound prospecting tactics. The strategy should be used with lower-level prospects and lower-tier accounts.

**Snippets** - Content created for BDRS and SDRs to use to create hyper-personalized sequences, one-off emails, or to use for reaching out to prospects via LinkedIn.

**Warm Calling** - The method used to strategically incorporate phone calls and voicemails into an outbound prospecting workflow. The idea is to optimize outbound productivity by only using the phone to call *engaged*, *validated*, and/or *VIP* prospects.

## Segmentation of BDR Team
The Business Development team aligns to the [Commercial](/handbook/sales/commercial/),Large, and PubSec sales teams. These teams are broken down into three segments: [Large, Mid-Market and SMB](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#segmentation) which are based on the total employee count of the Global account. *Note: The commercial sales team includes both Mid-Market and SMB. This segmentation allows BDRs and Sales to be focused in their approach and messaging. The segments are aligned to a region/vertical and then divided one step further via territories in the regions. Our single source of truth for determining the number of employees is  Zoominfo.

## Sales Development Organization Standards

We hold our Sales Development Org accountable to three pillars:

- **Uphold daily activity metrics**, in terms of sequencing new leads, researching outbound accounts and actioning sequence steps in time.

    - MQLs to be sequenced within expected [activity metrics](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-lead-views).

    - Work lead records within Salesforce by leveraging [relevant sequence libraries in Outreach](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/#collections).


    - Use our Business Intelligence platforms like ZoomInfo or LinkedIn to verify the validity of inbound lead datapoints. Take appropriate actions to clean up and assure accuracy and consistency of SFDC/Outreach data. Add any additional information sourced from your research, or correct wrong data altogether.

    - Maintain a sense of ownership of data integrity in [Salesforce](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sfdc/) and [Outreach](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/#outreach-merge-and-delete). Clean up and assure accuracy and consistency of data. Add any additional information gathered from our Business Intelligence platforms, ZoomInfo or LinkedIn for example. about a LEAD, CONTACT, or ACCOUNT from our data source Zoominfo where you can into SFDC.

    - [Sequence steps](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/#activity) to be actioned within the same day of them being due. Move steps to a further date only because of national holidays affecting outreach (ie. Christmas day)

    - Maintain SFDC data integrity by [following the outbound workflow](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#outbound-workflow) in researching and prospecting accounts.


    - Maintain [cross-functional relationships](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#working-with-sales-1) in terms of outbound account planning. Attend each initial qualifying meeting (IQM) with the AE/SAL you work with. Document accurate up-to-date notes in SFDC, including adding the Contacts you have been in communication with and attaching all corresponding connects and attempts to the Contact record. Communicating with the AE/SAL teams before and after the meeting to ensure accurate briefs are provided and tangible mutually agreed-upon next steps are set.

- **Displaying business and sales accumen** in terms of appropriate use of sales methodologies and strategic preparation prior to each touchpoint with prospects.

    - Display business accumen and sales skills in personalizing inbound/outbound leads, in accordance with our [CoM email writing principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DF6bEtS9QF9idqBcK77RiLL04CKiFMuc0LDEM5N6RA/edit).

    - Display business accumen and sales skills is preparing for cold-calls, in accordance with our [CoM cold-calling principles](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#cold-calling-checklist)

    - [Collaborate with the Field Marketing team](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-event-promotion-and-sales-dev-org-follow-up) in terms of event outreach


## BDR and SDR Compensation and Quota

Quota is made up of the following depending on [sales segment](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#segmentation):
- [Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAOs)](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-sdr-alignment/#goals--targets)
- [ARR](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice) pipeline component
- 2-way communication must be documented on the Contact in the Opportunity to receive credit. Opportunities missing this documentation will not be considered for compensation and will not retire quota.
- For BDRs and SDRs who have SAO/ARR goals, compensation is based on the SAO attainment. ARR attainment is a qualifier for accelerator payments. Our aim is to land net new logos and expand to new customer business units, SAOs being our quantity metric and ARR our quality metric.  Our mission is to create good qualified pipeline for the company.
- BDRs and SDRs are not responsible for uptiering customer accounts from a paid lower tier to a higher tier, ie. from Premium to Ultimate, this is the responsibility of sales.

#### Visualization of Sales Development Career Path


![Sales Dev Career Path Visual](/images/handbook/marketing/sales-development/SalesDevCareer2.png)




## Flexible working
At GitLab we have flexible working hours. This means that you can organize your working day as you like and are not expected to arrive and leave at a set time every day, but we do expect MQL’s to be followed up within 1 hour (during business hours) so communication with your manager will be necessary if you plan to be out for an extended period of time. Managers will provide direction on the routing of leads during that time.

With a prospect-facing role in Sales Development, do keep in mind _when_ you are calling and emailing prospects:
 * The best times to call are early and late in the business day, so these may be best blocked for this activity.
 * Outreach allows you to schedule emails at set times. For outbound prospecting, the most effective emails are those that come in the early morning and early evening, so you can take advantage of this feature. On the other hand, inbound MQL’s *must* be handled regularly throughout your day as they come in.
 * Lunchtimes are good for outreach as most prospects have meeting blocks for three hours in the morning and then two hours mid-afternoon.
 * The above blocks you can use for account research and planning, customer meetings, or meetings with your sales reps, manager, peers, and teams.
 * Although you are not expected to start work and end work at the same time every day, please do keep in mind the normal business hours of your prospects, and make sure to schedule your own working hours to ensure you maximize opportunities.

In short, working at GitLab means that if you start the day early you can take a long lunch break to hit the gym or go grocery shopping in the middle of the day when it’s quiet, yet you can still do a full day’s work around that and don’t need to be accountable all the time, as long as you are available to call prospects and be available for prospect meetings during normal working hours for your region/territory.


## Sales Development Tools

You can find a detailed breakdown of the Sales Development Organizations tools and best practices on [this page of the handbook](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-development-tools/)

## BDR and SDR Inbound Workflow & Process
As a BDR or SDR, you will be focused on leads - both inbound and outbound. At the highest level, a lead is a person who shows interest in GitLab through inbound lead generation tactics or through outbound prospecting.


### Working Inbound Leads

#### What is an MQL?
The GitLab marketing team uses digital channels - social media, email, mobile/web apps, search engines, websites, etc - as well as in-person marketing activities to meet potential buyers where they are. When people interact with GitLab, we use lead scoring to assign a numerical value, or points, to each of these leads based on their actions and the information we have about them. Once a lead reaches 100 points, they are considered a [Marketing Qualified Lead](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#mql-and-lead-scoring) or MQL.


#### Inbound Process
SDRs are responsible for following up with MQLs by reviewing their information, reaching out, and working with them to understand their goals, needs, and problems. BDRs have the same responsibility for MQLs that come from one of their “actively working” accounts. Once you have that information, you can use our [qualification criteria](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/) to determine if this is someone who has strong potential to purchase our product and therefore should be connected with sales for next steps. As you are the connection between Marketing and Sales you want to make sure every lead you pass to the Sales team is as qualified as possible.

These MQLs will show up in your S1 or B1 lead and contact views in Salesforce. The other views, listed [here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#lead-and-contact-views), allow you to see your leads in a categorized way to simplify your workflow. Leads are routed to you and flow into your views via the tool [LeanData](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/leandata/) which takes each lead through a series of conditional questions to ensure it goes to the right person. Even though all SDRs leverage the same views, they will only show you leads that have been specifically routed to you. You will be responsible for following up with all of the leads in your MQL views by sequencing them using [Outreach.io](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/). Once sequenced, their lead status will change and they will move from your MQL views allowing you to have an empty view. Managers monitor all views to ensure they are cleared out. If you choose not to work a lead please unqualify it and state your reasons in the lead record.


### SDR Lead Routing Levels

The SDR Managers will be responsible for facilitating lead routing level changes at the beginning of each new month (when applicable) by making the requisite moves in LeanData and Drift.

#### Levels

**Disclaimer**: for SDRs that start mid-month, their first (partial) month will be deemed “month 0” for the purposes of these rules of engagement.

##### Onboarding

* Typical Timeframe: Months 0-1
* Parameters: SDR not on quota, leads are off in LeanData, Drift is off

##### Ramping

* Typical Timeframe: Month 2
* Parameters: SDR is on 50% quota, leads are set at 50% in LeanData, Drift is off

##### Expert

* Typical Timeframe: Months 3+
* Parameters: SDR is on full quota, leads are set at 100% in LeanData, SDR is added to Drift queues via access request. SDR is now able to create their own Outreach sequences (pending approval).
* To add SDRs to Drift, create a new [access request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new) and copy and paste in the code for the [Drift access request template](https://gitlab.com/-/ide/project/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/edit/master/-/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development/role_sales_development_representative_drift.md)

#### Performance Requirements

SDR Managers will monitor key metrics and ensure they are being handled effectively before advancing an SDR from Ramping to Expert:
* Pending MQLs addressed in timely manner
* Stalled Qualifying MQLs
* Overdue tasks
* Paused/Failed sequence states
* Pending opps with no next steps date
* Pending opps with overdue next steps dates
* Unqualified opps
* Calls
* Tanuki Tech progress


## Lead and Contact Views

#### SDR Lead Views

* **S1 View** - [MQL’s,](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#mql-and-lead-scoring)and "Hot" leads that need to be actioned within 60 minutes (i.e event)s, and Drift conversation leads for tenured SDRs
* **S2 View** - Only leads that are active in a HT touch sequence and have a phone number
* **S3 View** - Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls.  Each lead needs to either be active in a follow-up sequence, have an active task, or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.

#### BDR Lead Views

* **B1 View** - [MQL’s](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#mql-and-lead-scoring) and "Hot" leads that need to be actioned within 60 minutes
* **B2 View** - This is a view that you will clone in order to see leads associated with “Actively Working” accounts where you are the BDR Assigned. After you clone and modify the name of the view to include your name, you should enter your name into the 1st rule. Save and run the view. Sort by Last Interesting Moment Date to see the most recent. Here you can select which leads you should reach out to as part of your strategy for those account. You'll select the ones you want and change the owner to yourself. These will then show up in your B3 view so that you can easily sequence them.
* **B3 View** - Needs to be sequenced. They’re leads you chose to move into your name but they have not yet been sequenced.
* **B4 View** - Active HT sequenced leads that have a phone number - to help with call downs
* **B5 View** - Qualifying leads. These are leads that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either by email or through phone calls. Each lead needs to either be active in a follow up sequence, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date


#### BDR Contact Views

**Contact ownership is based on the BDR Assigned and Account owner fields. If you are the BDR Assigned on the account, you will be the owner of all contacts associated with that account. If there is no BDR Assigned, the account owner will be the owner of the contacts.**

* **B1 View** - Includes MQL’s, Hot contacts that require quick follow up
* **B2 View** - Contacts related to Actively working accounts that you can choose to sequence. Helps if you sort them by Last Interesting Moment date.
* **B3 View** - Active HT sequenced leads that have a phone number - to help with call downs
* **B4 View** - Qualifying leads. Contacts that you are actively qualifying in a back and forth conversation either on email or through phone calls. Each contact in this status needs to either be active in a follow up sequence, have an active task or have a future meeting scheduled which can be seen in a future “last activity” date.

## SDR/BDR ROE and Inbound Lead Management

### Definitions

* **Rules of Engagement (RoE):** Defines who has ownership over a lead, who gets credit for the SAO, and how the SDRs and BDRs can work together to achieve goals.

* **BDR Prospecting Status:** Salesforce status that will includ Queued, Actively Working, Worked in FY, and Restricted

* **Partner Prospecting Status:** If this is populated, the lead/contact is being worked by a partner and the Sales Dev team should not proceed with outreach. Instead the rep should change the ownership to Marketo Integration. BDRs should not bring these into their outreach on AWA’s.

* **Actively Working Status:** An account researched and chosen by the BDR and/or SAL- based on alignment to ICP, news insights, company initiative, intent, ABM list etc. This is an account that the BDR will proactively be performing strategic outreach to. There is no limit to how long an account can stay in “Actively working” status as long as outreach is continuing to be made.
BDRs will work these leads.

* **Requirements to remain in Actively Working status:** All  “BDR comments” fields will need to be populated within 10 days of moving into “Actively Working” status and a minimum of 5 people will need to be added to sequences within 15 days of the “Actively Working” timestamp. Accounts will move back to queued should criteria not be met.
    * MM has a limit of 150 accounts in “Actively Working” status, Large has a limit of 100.

* **Queued status:** Accounts with this BDR prospecting status are waiting to be moved into Actively Working
    * SDRs will work these MQLs.

* **Worked in FY status:** Accounts with this BDR prospecting status are actively worked but has not had prospects active in sequence in the last 30 days. Being moved to “Worked in FY”  indicates that they have gone through being an Actively Working” account this FY. An account in this status can be moved back into “Actively Working” working status later that year if desired.
    * SDR will work MQLs for that account.

* **Restricted status:** SAL indicated that this account cannot be worked by BDR. BDRs should be the only ones changing the BDR Prospecting Status. So if you’re asked to move an account into Restricted Status, please make sure you note the reason for the restriction in the BDR comments section under “BDR account research”.
    * SDR will reroute to the BDR Assigned for these accounts
    * BDR to liaise with Sales to decide what to do with inbound Leads:
        * If there's a duplicate Contact please convert the Lead and merge into the Contact
        * If there's an active Opportunity related to a Lead, then the lead should be converted and attached to the Opportunity.
        * DO NOT simply flag the Lead with an Accepted Lead Status as this will dirty our data

## Rules of Engagement Quick Guide

* **Is the MQL from an Existing Account?**
    *   **No:** It is worked by the SDR team
    *   **Yes:** Check the BDR Prospecting Status

* **Is the Account in “Actively Working” Status?**
     *  **No:** It is worked by the SDR team
     *  **Yes:** Check for Activity

        * **Does the account have activity placed by the BDR in the last 30 days?**
            *   **Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned
            *   **No:**  Check to see if there are leads related to the account that have activity using [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008RfvU)

        * **When you modify [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O8X000008RfvU) based on company name and email domain, do you see any activity in the last 30 days?**
            *   **Yes:** It is worked by the BDR Assigned
            *   **No:** It is worked by the SDR Team.

Next Steps: SDR chatters the BDR Assigned and lets them know you didn't find activity and will go ahead and sequence the lead. FYI's the BDR Manager. BDR Manager will work with the BDR to put the account into the correct BDR Prospecting status. If a BDR is able to relay information that was not picked up in the SDR's research, the SDR should end the sequence if the prospect hasn't engaged and change lead ownership to BDR so the BDR can reach out. If the SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between SDR and BDR. **Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.**

* **Is the Account in “Queued” Status?**
     * **Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team
 * **Is the Account in “Worked in FY” Status?**
    * **Yes:** It is worked by the SDR team
* **Is the Account in “Restricted” Status?**
    * **Yes:** It should be routed to the BDR assigned. The BDR assigned will chatter the SAL about whether they'd like them to reach out or whether they would like to own that responsibility. They'll have a certain window to respond (likely 24-48 hours depending on what JB says).
        * If they reply back that the BDR can work, the BDR will continue with the prospect as a lead record and take action.
        * If they reply back that they want to be responsible, the BDR will convert the lead so that it becomes a contact.

 **_After determining an MQL is to be worked by the SDR team:_**

* **Is the new MQL related to an existing MQL that is part of the same account?**

    * **No**: The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

    * **Yes**: Check the status of the existing MQL

* **Is the existing MQL in Accepted or Qualifying status?**

    * **No**: The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin

    * **Yes**: Check the activity on the existing MQL

* **Is there activity in the last 30 days or a follow up task scheduled for the future?**

    * **Yes**: The MQL should be worked by the owner of the existing MQL

    * **No**: The MQL can be worked by the SDR that received it through the round robin. If you are not sure, double-check with the related SDR.

    If the related SDR relays information that was not picked up in the new SDR's research, the new SDR should end any active sequence if the prospect hasn't engaged and change lead ownership to the team member who has been engaged so they can reach out. If the new SDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the new SDR and the related SDR. **Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.**

## Inbound Lead Management

**Begin with Enriching and using Find Duplicates**
1. On SFDC lead record, you will be using the  **Find Duplicates** button and **LinkedIn** and follow the workflow below.
2. First Click **“LinkedIn”** to see if you can enrich any title or company info which will help ensure correct search of duplicates and inform the collection you’ll use in Outreach.
3. Check **“LeanData Matched Account”** and **ZoomInfo** sections:
    *   For Commercial leads (SMB and MM), if the existing SFDC account type equals "Customer", press 'Convert to Account' and convert the lead to a contact for that account. In case of a Contact Request lead source, please also chatter the Account Owner and inform them of the context of the message for them to action. **An exception exists if they've only bought CI/CD or storage; these can still be worked by the SDR. Leads should only be converted if the Customer account purchased Premium or Ultimate.**
    *   If an existing SFDC Large/Enterprise Customer account already exists, verify that the SFDC lead/prospect is not part of the existing GitLab subscription before working the lead by sending a short snippet like, "Hi XYZ, Thanks for reaching out. ABC company current has a GitLab subscription, are you currently using a GitLab license and if so, what version?". If they are, please follow the "Convert to Account" instructions above.
    *   Read the ZoomInfo description to check for **USA** PubSec indicators which will include words like the following in the description: County, City Of, State, University, College, Defense, Intelligence, Agency, Mission, Mission Critical, Mission Support, Speed to Mission, System Integrator, Contract Vehicle, Government Bid, Government Contract, Civilian, or Task Order.  **Canadian government leads get routed to the AMER commercial team.**
4. Press **Find Duplicates**
    *   SDRs/BDRs should use this screen to check to see if 1) the matched account is an “Actively Working” account that would cause the lead to need to be re-routed to the BDR Assigned or 2) whether there is a duplicate record that needs to be merged or 3) whether there is another lead at that company active in sequence.
        *   The lead owner will make sure to use search techniques that allow for the most accurate results. On the Find Duplicates screen, they will need to scroll to the `Matched Account` section to see if the BDR prospecting status is “Actively Working”. If so, they will need to transfer to BDR.
        *   If it is not an Actively Working account, then the next step is to scroll to the top to see if there are `Matched Leads` or `Matched Contacts` that are a match. If so, then our merging process here will need to be followed.
        *  The lead owner should also check the `Matched Opportunities` Section to see if there is an active Opportunity for the account be it SAL/AE-owned or Channel owned (`Resale Partner` last column) The lead owner should determine if this lead is related to any active opportunity and then pass along the lead if relevant.
        *   If there is another lead at the same company with a Lead Status of MQL, ownership is determined by the lead whose MQL Date is the earliest. If there is another lead at the same company with a Lead Status of Accepted or Qualifying, pass the MQL to the owner of the accepted/qualifying lead.
    *  Should a BDR receive a lead not associated with an Actively Working account, they are responsible for assigning the lead back to the SDR who assigned it to them. If it came from LeanData, they should chatter mktgops support on the record so that it can be routed correctly.

5. Drift leads associated with **“Actively Working”** accounts
    *  SDR will be routed the lead and will need to quickly offer a meeting with the assigned BDR. From there they will move the lead into qualifying status, transfer ownership to the BDR and click to send notification.


**Outreach & Marketo**

If the lead is yours to work based on all of the above, sequence them in Outreach using the FY24 inbound sequence that correlates with the Last Interesting Moment. You can also look at the initial source and Marketo insights to get a holistic view of what a lead is looking into. There is an Outreach collection of sequences for inbound leads for each region. These collections contain a primary sequence for nearly every inbound lead scenario.
* **Primary Sequence**: a sequence created by SDR leadership that should be used by all reps to follow up with inbound leads
*  [**Sequence collection**](https://app1a.outreach.io/content-collections): a group of sequences compiled by region
    * [FY24 Global Inbound High Touch Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2269%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)
    * [FY24 Global Inbound Low Touch Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2271%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)
    * [FY24 Inbound Languages Collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?queryFilters=%5B%7B%22attribute%22%3A%22collection%22%2C%22operator%22%3A%22is%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%2270%22%5D%7D%5D&sortBy=recent&sortDirection=desc)
*  **Last Interesting Moment**: data pulled in from our marketing automation software, [Marketo](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/), that tells you the last action a lead took.
*  [**Initial source**](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#initial-source): first known action someone took when they entered our database
*  [**Marketo Sales Insights (MSI)**](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/marketo/#marketo-sales-insight): a section on the lead/contact/account in Salesforce that shows you compiled data around actions a lead/contact has taken

#### High touch and Low touch sequences:

A high touch sequence should be used for higher-quality leads. High touch sequences require you to add in more personalization and have more touch points across a longer period of time, including phone calls and LinkedIn Connect requests. Low touch sequences are typically automated and run for a shorter period of time. We define higher quality leads based on the volume of inbound you have to manage as well as whether the lead has has 1-2 of the following for MM/Large accounts:
* Valid company email domain or company name
* Phone number
* Title related to our buying/influencer personas
* Demandbase intent
* Set up for company/team use checkbox equals true
* Account has X # of Developers (MM/Large nuances)
* LinkedIn profile
* SMB lead may only need to have  2-3 of the above
* Different teams may have nuances so please check in with your manager for their feedback.


#### Questions about a lead?

* If you feel you have been misrouted a lead, chatter mktgops-support on the lead record. They will reassign.
* If you have a question about the behavior of a lead or any other operational issue, you can use the slack channel #mktgops
* If lead is associated with an account where there are duplicates, chatter sales support on the account record with links to duplicate account(s) and ask them to merge. The chatter should be on the record that seems to be the most active account.
* For contact requests received requesting event sponsorship, please change ownership to GitLab Evangelist in SFDC & be sure to "check the box" to send a notification.
* If a lead only has CI minutes, but no paid subsriptions they are considered a prospect and not a customer.


**Technical questions from leads?**
* [Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/)
* Slack channels

    * #support_self-managed
    * #support_gitlab-com

#### Dealing with spam and or unneeded leads

Every so often you may be assigned a lead that has no value to GitLab and is not worth keeping within our database. Qualities that define these types of leads include:
  * Lead info is an incoherent, jumbled combination of characters with no meaning
  * Lead info is an obvious forgery, e.g. The odds of someone being named `Batman Batman` are very low
  * Email supplied is from a temporary email domain that cannot be contacted after a certain time limit due to email self-termination

When you come across leads that fall into this category, it is best to remove them from our Salesforce database entirely. The process to remove leads is to add the lead to the [SPAM DELETION Salesforce campaign](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/7014M000001dphz). A few details about this process:
  * Only add leads to this campaign if you are 100% certain they are worth removing from the database
  * MktgOps cannot recover leads removed through this process. You should consider the removal permanent, so be careful
  * The `campaign member status` used when adding to the campaign does not matter, only `campaign membership` matters for this process
  * The removal process, which is completed via `Marketo`, runs once a day at 12:05am PDT
  * If you require leads to be cleared out before the scheduled time, please ask in the `mktgops` Slack channel. Please keep unscheduled requests to a minimum
  * If you spot a number of leads with the same domain, please [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new) with Marketing Ops to have that email domain added to a block list. You can still follow the steps above to delete them.

#### Lead sequencing and dispositioning through Outreach

Lead/contact statuses allow anyone in Salesforce to understand where a lead is at in their journey. The automation mentioned below is all done through an Outreach.io trigger.

* Once a lead has been placed in an Outreach sequence, the lead status will automatically change from MQL, Inquiry, or Raw to Accepted marking that you are actively working on this lead.
* When a lead responds to you via email, their status will again automatically change. This time it will change from Accepted to Qualifying. You will manage these leads from your S3 and B5 lead views.
    * If you are not working on qualifying this lead further, you will need to manually change the status to Nurture so that this lead is back in Marketing nurture and isn’t stuck in your My Qualifying view. If you have spoken to the lead by phone and are qualifying them, you need to manually change the status to from Accepted to Qualifying
* When looking at your qualifying view please sequence leads that have no recent last activity + no active tasks + are not actively being sequenced into one of our follow up sequences that have the "Follow up Ruleset Sequences". You can read more about our [rulesets here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/#rulesets)
* If a lead finishes an Outreach sequence without responding, the lead status will automatically change to unresponsive or nurture in seven days if there is still no response.
* If a lead responds, the BDR/SDR is to schedule a call/meeting using [Outreach’s meetings feature.](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/outreach/#outreach-meetings)
* The only time you will need to manually change lead status outside of what is mentioned in the previous bullets is if you for some reason don't use an Outreach sequence to reach out to someone or if you need to unqualify a lead for bad data etc.
* If you check the `Inactive lead` or `Inactive contact` checkbox, signifying that this person no longer works at the company, any running sequence will automatically be marked as finished.

## Follow Up Outreach Sequences

* For SDRS and BDRS that want to sequence leads in their qualifying views we created [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKE24LRJbcc) to help you create a workflow around [this follow up sequence](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/9383)

* [The same video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOKgeIi5yfA) also showcases the [Auto Follow Up to Book a Meeting Sequence](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/9543) SDRs and BDRs can use when a prospect responds to one of their sequences.

## Process for scheduling an IQM with AE/SAL

Whether it be from inbound follow up or outbound prospecting, you’re going to be engaging with prospects who are directly involved in a project or team related to the potential purchase of GitLab within a buying group, either as an evaluator, decision-maker, technical buyer, or influencer. During those interactions, you’ll be looking to gather information related to the SAO qualification criteria.


### Qualification Criteria and SAOs

Qualification criteria is a minimum set of characteristics that a lead must have in order to be passed to sales and become a Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO), these are split into [Inbound and Outbound Criteria.](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunities)

As an SDR or BDR, you will work to connect with inbound/outbound leads that you get a response from to obtain the applicable information required. This information is tracked on the qualification criteria on the LEAD, CONTACT, and OPPORTUNITY objects in Salesforce. In order to obtain an SAO, you will need to have the 'required' information filled out on the opportunity including documented 2-way communication on the Contacts in the Opportunity.

#### When do I create an Opportunity?

    1. **You have scheduled time with AE/SAL to speak with the prospect.** <br>
If you are scheduling time with an AE/SAL to speak to the prospect based on a qualifying conversation you have had with the prospect, an opportunity needs to be created and placed in stage 0. On the opportunity, all "required qualification" fields need to be filled in.

2. **You have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.** <br>
If you have a meaningful two-way communication with a prospect, but have not had the required qualification criteria to move to the Sales team, you can create an opportunity under your name so that you better track your warm conversations. These opportunities may also be used for better collaboration with your team, as they can be reviewed and brain-stormed upon during team huddles.

#### Who owns the opportunity at this point?
1. **You have scheduled time with AE/SAL to speak with the prospect.** <br>
When you have entered the qualification criteria onto the opportunity, and have received calendar confirmation from all parties for the intro call with sales, you will change ownership to the AE/SAL. After you have saved opp owner, you will add yourself to the BDR/SDR field. The opportunity will remain in stage 0.

2. **You have obtained a commitment/willigness from a prospect to discuss further.** <br>
At this point, the opportunity will be in your ownership but you can not have yourself listed in the Business Development Representative or Sales Development Representative field. There is a validation rule that will not allow the opp owner and the SDR/BDR representative field to be the same member.

#### When will it be credited as an SAO?
After the SAL/AE meets with the prospect to verify and supplement qualification criteria, they will move the opportunity into Stage 1. The AE/SAL is expected to move the opportunity into the correct stage within 48 hours of the meeting reflected in the "Next Step" date field.

If the opportunity is for a new group of users in a Large account where sales is working on a large "central" opportunity, then your opportunity should be merged to that opportunity for you to get credit for the users you have brought to the deal. [See under Stage 8](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-stages) in the Sales Go To Market Handbook


* [ How to create an opportunity](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#creating-a-new-business-opportunity-from-lead-record)

Before scheduling the meeting with the AE/SAL, you will need to verify the sales organization RoE

1. On ZoomInfo or other sources, verify the [parent/child segmentation:](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/rules-of-engagement/). All accounts in a hierarchy will adopt the MAX segmentation of any account in the hierarchy and ownership between segments is determined accordingly.
2. On ZoomInfo or other sources, verify the HQ of the company or the ultimate user. Unless the account is Named, lead ownership is determined based on the HQ of a company, regardless of the lead's location geographically.
3. If there's an account already assigned to a different segment, please do not immediately pass leads that your research says should be for another segment. Instead, please chatter ASM and the current account owner with your data. If there is a consensus, please then tag Sales Support for the reassignment. Please be mindful of discrepancies between our SSOT and LinkedIn. There are many cases where LI employee count does not indicate the reality of their employee size. For example, in companies with commonly used names, LI can overstate their employee count. On the other hand, LI can understate the employee count of companies that do not have a very strong tech presence.

#### Lead/Contact Review Admin Lead Record Section

As part of your MQL conversion (lead to account) process, we will need your help in verifying the company address so the account and/or opportunity will populate with the correct territory owner. The fields in the Lead/Contact Review Admin section of the record will all need to be updated with the correct information if there is differing company address information.

These fields will not have an approval process therefore we are relying on Sales Dev to choose reputable sources (ie. an email from a prospect confirming address). The new information will be added into the Lead Waterfall Address field and ETM will rely on this field to route the opportunity when opened.

A list of example "Reputable Sources" will come shortly

#### How do I request SAO credit on a Web Direct opportunity?
On the opportunity record in Saleforce, compose a new Chatter message that includes the following:
1. Tag your manager (do not tag Sales Support)
2. Include a link to the record in Salesforce that shows your related two-way activity in the past 60 days. If your related activity is a phone call, you must have entered the details of the phone call into the Qualification Notes field on the lead record at the time of the call in order for it to be considered. Qualification Notes entered after the Web Direct opportunity has been created will not be considered for credit.
3. Explain how you influenced their decision to purchase GitLab (helped with evaluation, uncovered a need, provided value, etc)

Your manager will review the information and decide whether SAO credit is warranted. If confirmed, they will Chatter Sales Support to add you to the opportunity. If rejected, they will communicate to you the reasoning for their decision.

#### Opportunity Creation Workflow

![Opportunity Creation Workflow](/images/handbook/marketing/sales-development/Opportunitycreationworkflow.png)

## BDR Outbound Process

BDR outbound lead generation is done by prospecting to companies and individuals who could be a great fit for our product. Prospecting is the process of finding and developing new business through searching for potential customers with the end goal of moving these people through the sales funnel until they eventually convert into customers.

BDRs will work closely with their dedicated SAL or AE to choose which accounts move into “Actively Working”. Together they will build a strategy for those companies. It is crucial that outreach is very intentional and strategic. When reaching out, we want BDRs to offer value and become a trusted advisor, ensuring a positive impression is left whether there is current demand or not.

Below, we break down our outbound process in 10 actionable steps, and we include a 2' video walkthrough of each step along with any associated documentation.

### 1. Defining the scope of the outbound campaign

To be able to accurately forecast our results, and pipeline required, it is important to conceptualize and defining a constant calendar of micro-campaigns as the first step to any outbound process.

To brainstorm and conceptualize campaigns, the best practice is to have a monthly recurring call between all the BDR members of your region. In this call information gathered from prospects on calls/emails, information sources from news sources, or any other type of datapoint can be used to discuss and come up with the micro-campaigns that the team will run for the near future.

These can take the form of:

- Competitor Campaigns (ie. targetting users of competing technologies)<br>
- Campaigns based on external events (ie. world evensts)<br>
- Campaigns that utilize Field Marketing or Digital Program initiatives (ie. DevSecOps survey results)<br>

These campaigns [need to be specific and defined](https://smallbusinessbonfire.com/how-to-run-an-effective-micromarketing-campaign/), in the following ways:

- Duration<br>
- Target Demographic<br>
- Intended Messaging, Value Driver or Compelling Event<br>
- Ultimate Goal or Outcome<br>

All of the above will be used in the next steps that we'll walk you through in setting up the campaign.

### 2. Evaluating Database Options

Having clearly defined the target audience of the micro-campaign, the next step is to evaluate which of our tools can be used to source the specific prospects.

Below, we outline the main datapoints that each of our tools can provide, and how they can be used to help structure your micro-campaign:

**Cognism:**

| Functionality | Feature Benefit | Tool Availability
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Technologies Used  | can be used for sourcing accounts that use competitor technologies | ZoomInfo, Cognism |
| Financial Information | can be used for sourcing accounts that have recently secured funding or have been reporting increases/decreases to their annual earnings  | Zoominfo, Cognism, Sales Navigator |
| Industries | can be used to source accounts from specific industries | Zoominfo, Cognism, Sales Navigator |
| Personnel Changes | can be used to source accounts that are hiring for specific positions | ZoomInfo, Sales Navigator, Cognism |
| Hiring per department | can be used to source accounts that have increases or decreases in headcount across departments | Cognism |
| Scoops and Attributes | can be used to source accounts that have specific information publicized for product launches, key pain points and so on | ZoomInfo |

### 3. Cross-Referencing with DemandBase

In additional to our B2B toolstack, we also use DemandBase to narrow down the validity of our results. Demandbase offers a lot of additional datapoints like [qualification scores](/handbook/marketing/account-based-marketing/demandbase/), that can be used to narrow down a big data set to a hyper-targetted prospecting list.

To cross-reference with Demandbase, please follow the steps below:

1. Export the list(s) sourced from ZoomInfo/Cognism to .CSV by following the steps [here](https://help.zoominfo.com/18435-account-search/exporting-companies) or [here](https://help.cognism.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4407711013650-Navigating-the-Company-Contact-full-page-View-)<br>
2. Make sure that the exported .CSV has the company domain and company name, these will be used by DemandBase to match accounts to their database.<br>
3. Follow the [steps here](https://support.demandbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404424750861-Create-and-Access-Account-Lists) to upload the .CSV to demandbase<br>
4. Navigate to Account Lists in DemandBase and find the report template named [ADD REPORT NAME HERE]<br>
5. Clone the report and go to the selector tab<br>
6. Change the countries or regions to the ones that you are covering, along with the employee count<br>
7. Make sure that the 1 or 2 `Member of List` fields are assigned to your new account imports<br>
8. If the results are too extensive, you can add the DemandBase fields `Qualification Score`, `Pipeline Predict` or `Engagement Minutes` to drill down results even further.<br>

### 4. Manual Research on Accounts

No matter how efficiently we're trying to use our toolchain, these tools are still prone to error, and manual research is required to best shortlist the prospecting lists that cross-referencing will provide.

Manual research will also provide additional context that can be used to hyper-personalize your outreach to your prospects.

For each account that you want to investigate, start with SFDC to make sure that there are no duplicate accounts. The report templates in DemandBase should exclude existing customers or accounts actively prospected, but we cannot automatically exclude accounts that have a different naming or domain on salesforce (ie. GitLab and GTLB)

The importance of diligent manual research will lead to the below efficiencies:

→ Better use of time in the long-run by making sure accounts are indeed within your segment and territory, or are not duplicates. <br>
→ Avoiding unecessary RoE conflicts by making sure there are no hidden parent accounts that would cause SAO ownership to be re-assigned to other segments in the future.<br>

**To double-check the account on Salesforce:**

1. Search for the account name on SFDC
2. Search for the account email domain on SFDC
3. Search for the account website domain of SFDC
4. Search for the Account's HQ address, along with any regional business unit address.

**To hyper-personalize your messaging:**

1. Search for past opportunities on SFDC<br>
    i. Check the qualification notes<br>
    ii. Check the unqualified reasons by the AE team<br>
    iii. Check past email communication on the activity records<br>

2. Search for the account record on SFDC<br>
    i. Check Account Rank notes by the AE team<br>
    ii. Check the PathFactory, ZoomInfo, Marketo integration tabs<br>
    iii. Check their product usage information (if applicable)<br>
    iv. Check their LAM Dev Count<br>

3. Search for relevant leads on SFDC<br>
    i. Check for past communication<br>
    ii. Check for Last Interesting Moment and how it connects to their title and lead source to determine their compelling events<br>
    iii. Check for Web Activity on Marketo and PathFactory to gauge past interest<br>

4. Cross-reference with External sources<br>
    i. Search LinkedIn Insights for company growth, financials and recent news<br>
    ii. Search company webpage for recent news, career openings or specific technologies used<br>
    iii. Search online sources like newsletter or crunchbase<br>

4. Cross-reference the above with HighSpot<br>
    i. Check for relevant playbooks based on company size<br>
    ii. Check for relevant messaging based on persona<br>
    iii. Check for relevant pain-points based on value driver<br>

### 5. Exporting Accounts and Leads to SFDC, and adding to your Outbound Pipeline

After having manually shortlisted the accounts that are applicable to your campaign, the next step is to determine the relevant prospects per account and export them to SFDC. It is important to add accounts to your outbound pipeline so that AEs and other SDRs/BDRs know this is an account that is already being touched, and to avoid confusion or multiple people approaching the same prospects. Before moving an account into “Actively Working Status”, make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.

**To determine which prospects to enroll per account, please follow the steps below:**

1. Identify the idea value drivers to be used for the account's pain-points through your manual research, as outlined above
2. Determine which personas would most benefit from the specific value drivers by using our CoM documentation on HighSpot
3. Run queries for the specific titles on ZoomInfo, and export to CRM

**To export to CRM, please follow the guidelines below:**

1. Click the Export to CRM button on [ZoomInfo](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/zoominfo/#training)
2. That's it
3. No, really.

**To fill in the BDR fields, please follow the guidelines below:**

1. Use the format found on [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EN2U8wrUdti4MTxCNceoOlltAmtUt4pqN1GxwRTCnK4/edit)
2. Copy-Paste the Structure to the `BDR Account Research` field and populate accordingly.
3. Populate the `BDR Next Step Date` to be at the end of the account's sequence length (typically one month out)

### 6. Maintaining a clean pipeline, and using BDR fields for cross-functional collaboration.

1. To review your current pipeline, along with any leads with next steps, please refer to your segments dashboards by going to SFDC > Dashboards and searching for `watch and help`. Team specific variants of these dashboard components will also be found on your team's dashboard. These dashboards will give you a bird's eye view of what actions are required from to maintain a clean pipeline, in terms of:
    i. Accounts with BDR fields past due
    ii. Prospects with sequence steps past due
    iii. Prospects that have been moved to `Qualifying` status but have not had any outreach since. <br>

2. To utilize the BDR fields in maintaing an automated 1:1 outbound agenda with the AEs/SALs that you collaborate with, please follow the [link here](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sales-sdr-alignment/#expectations-and-strategic-processes) for a list or report templates that may be cloned and customized.

**Important Note**
You do not have to wait until the end of the month or quarter to change the BDR prospecting status, you just have to make sure you stay under the limit for your segment and move the account to either “Queued” or “Worked in FY” based on criteria.

BDR Account views are to help with territory organization. It is very important for BDRs and their manager to update the BDR assigned field for their territory. Contacts ownership will be based on the BDR Assigned to the account. BDRs will be responsible for contact follow up should they MQL. BDRs will also be responsible for any leads that MQL when they’re related to accounts where they are the BDR Assigned and the account is in “Actively Working” status.

**Account views**

* **B1 View**- All accounts in territory, (clone) - This view will need to be cloned to be customized to the accounts in the territory the BDR is aligned to. It will allow the BDR to mass update the BDR Assigned field. The BDR manager should work with the BDR on the fields needed in the logic.
* **B2 View**- My BDR Assigned accounts, (clone) - This view will need to be cloned to be customized to accounts where you are the BDR assigned. Once set up, it will allow the BDR to mass update the 'BDR Prospecting Status' field to show which ones they will be "Actively Working'. They can also use this view to move into other statuses.
* **B3 View**- My Actively Working accounts, clone - This view will need to be cloned to be customized to show “Actively Working” accounts where you are the BDR assigned.

**Before moving an account into “Actively Working Status”**, the BDR will do a search using this [Demandbase list](https://web.demandbase.com/o/d/p/l/261084/l) to make sure there have been no MQLs or opportunities created from that account within the past 30 days, and there are no leads from that account in Qualifying status with activity in the last 30 days or with a future task date set. If you are not sure, double-check with the related AE, SDR or BDR.

If a related AE or SDR relays information that was not picked up in the BDR's research, the BDR should end any active sequence if the prospect hasn't engaged and change lead ownership to the team member whose been engaged so they can reach out. If the BDR has engaged with the prospect, there will need to be a coordinated handoff worked out between the BDR and the related team member. **Note: Only activity logged in SFDC will be recognized as activity.**

Exception to the process:
* the BDR can see that the MQL was put into a low touch sequence, or;
* the existing MQL is from a large account where BDR outreach can be made into different units or subsidiaries in that account.
If so, can ask SAL to request via chatter on the lead record that this account be placed into “Actively Working” so that BDR can reach out to others at the account.

Accounts should not be moved to “Actively Working” until the BDR is ready to begin account research, strategy, and sequencing leads. There will be a set # of days that a BDR has to complete these actions before the account moves back to a BDR prospecting status of “Queued”

Ideas for account research and strategy: "coming soon"

* Example: You can focus on Closed Lost Opportunities once they are older than 30 days, in line with the Sales Handbook [Opportunity Stages](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-stages)

### Best Practices for Outbound BDRs

### Cold-Calling Checklist

Before calling any Lead or Contact, BDRs must ensure that the `Do Not Call` box is unchecked.  If you speak to any anyone, including prospects and existing contacts, who ask you not to call them again, you must check this box. However, please do not delete the number as we need to know which number requested not to be called again. For any individuals who are opted-in to email, you may ask them if they wish to be called. If they express a desire to be called, you are then permitted to uncheck the `Do Not Call` box if it was previously checked.  Also, if an individual expresses independently via email a wish to be called, you may uncheck the `Do Not Call` box.  This email must be present in SFDC as proof of your authority to uncheck this box.  You cannot send email requests to individuals not opted-in to email asking whether they would like to be called.

Our cold-calling best practices typically consist of 4 elements. A pattern interrupt, an elevator pitch and, if required, objection/trap-setting questions and Up-Front Contracts.

To be effective, these need to be customized to the individuals we call as per the logic below:
* Different Geographical Business Cultures
* Personality Type as per the DISC model
* Individual's Role and Responsibilities
* Business’ Needs and Objectives

The main documentation may be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3iV_WW5fRidRN5H8-3SZVAAr3ffEvjxUC6cW5SFXDM/edit) and the library of resources [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhxVwy4DoEvFco_wXeOLb0DLtVIfo7wQ)

### Up-Front Contract

Typically used for scheduled calls and Up-Front Contracts. UFCs can also be used as a defense mechanism when cold calling does not go as planned. For cold-calling, UFCs are used when the prospect can commit to 15’ at the time of the call. If they commit to a 15’ for a later time, UFCs are used to open the call and set the agenda then.

Explore the main documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7qEq8g3eHh5-oagERGvNmatiOV3JXi9Tw46SKWwpNM/edit)

### Decision Maker Discovery

The questions below are suggestions to be used while doing a discovery call, in order to identify the decision making process, and to meet the outbound accepted SAO as per the guidelines [here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#criteria-for-outbound-sales-accepted-opportunity-sao)

* Who gets involved while evaluating a tool at {{company}}?
* Would you expect anyone to challenge your initiative, and if so can I help by connecting with anyonse else on your end?
* If you as a {{title}} wanted to purchase GitLab, what process internally would you have to follow, and how can we help you navigate it?
* What challenges do you expect to face when trying to pitch this change internally? Who has a say in this and what do they care about the most?

### Email Writing Cheat Sheet

The table below shows the Command of the Message Email Writing Checklist.

It aims to outline the structure of the emails we write to prospects. Emails should be written in each person’s language and tone and make sure to include the CoM frameworks as per the outline below.

Additionally, you can use the matrix below as a quick-cheet to determine what datapoints can be used for personalization.


| Location | Information |
|--------- | ----------- |
| LinkedIn | Have they recently been promoted? - What are the specific responsibilities stated on their page you are trying to help them with? |
| Company strategy from website | What are the company's strategic initiatives? (become more agile?, improve internal business systems?, focus on speed to market on delivery? Streamlining expenditure? |
| Google search name of contact | Do they have any blogs? Have they featured in any articles?, Have they any personal achievements celebrated?, Do they have any side projects? |

### Database Segmentation
The SFDC prospect database is split into five segments: Core users, free GitLab.com users, trial prospects, current customer "leads" and other prospects. We have checkboxes for these, most of which will automatically populate. **However**, the `Core User` checkbox in Leads and Contacts needs to be checked by the BDR/SDR or Sales rep once the prospect has confirmed *in writing or on the phone* that they are using Core as we cannot rely on our product analytics alone as it does not cover all users.

### Outbound Workflow
**IMPORTANT**: EMEA reps, old leads/contacts for EU nations can only be called or emailed if they were in our system from May 2018 or later. Any lead/contact that was brought into our system prior would need to optin to communication. Any new leads/contacts can only be called or emailed if they have been brought in from ZoomInfo. You can also leverage LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

The [BDR outbound framework](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=%20Outbound%20Process%20Framework%22%40gitlab.com) (sample is linked) will walk you through both strategy and execution of outbound prospecting.

When creating new prospects in SFDC these should be added as Leads to the system. New Leads can for example be prospects you are talking to on LinkedIn, prospects you are introduced to by someone at GitLab, or by other Leads or Contacts in SFDC.
Everyone you are contacting should exist on SFDC so that you, your manager, and the Account owner have a full picture of who you are prospecting into. LinkedIn conversations can be sent to SFDC using the "Copy to CRM" feature within the LinkedIn Sales Navigator chat platform.

If you have a list you would like to import to SFDC please follow this [List Import](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/list-import/) process on our Marketing Operations page which outlines how to import CSVs and ZoomInfo Prospects into the system.

## RoE Common Questions

**Q:** Should BDRs flag duplicate accounts?
**A:** Yes. However, they do not have the ability to merge it themselves so should chatter @Sales Support to do it.

**Q:** How do we resolve a dispute over SAO credit?:
**A:** SDR and BDR first try to talk through a solution
If no agreement:
Managers will determine a solution
If no agreement between the managers:
Escalate to Senior Leadership
Double credit nor double compensation will be given

**Q:** Who will be handling inquiries from an SDR/BDR standpoint?
**A:** Inquiries will go to an open queue. SDR’s will not work them. We want to give marketing time to progress these to MQLs.
**A:** BDR’s can work leads in all statuses if they are related to their “Actively working” accounts. Outreach to these leads would be part of their account strategy.

**Q:** What if a prospect comes back directly to the BDR much delayed, when the account is not marked as “Actively Working” anymore, but resulting from personalized messaging?
**A:** Yes, if they email, reply via LI, or call the BDR directly, the BDR will need to check that the lead is in queue ownership. If so, they must move the account back to “Actively Working”, so that the lead can be put into their ownership.

## BDR Event Promotion and Sales Dev Org Follow Up

To increase engagement at Field and Corporate Marketing events, it’s helpful to have BDR’s involved with pre-event outreach, on-site participation, or a combination of both.
Learn more about [Field](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/) and [Corporate Marketing](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/) via their linked handbook pages.

### Approvals Required
The FMM Regional team & the AMER or EMEA/APAC Regional Senior BDR Manager will review the upcoming quarter event calendar to discuss which events needs BDR support and what level of support would be needed. The Regional Senior BDR Manager will sign off on the related event support by referencing the "BDR approved" column in the [Marketing Calendar SSOT worksheet](/handbook/marketing/#marketing-calendar). FMMs will then open the related FMM/ISR/SDR issue mentioning the Regional Senior BDR Manager. The Regional Sr. BDR Manager will assign a Manager DRI who will then include related BDRs participating in the event's BDR pre and post tasks.

### Sales Development Team Member Selection Best Practices
Best practices for selecting sales development team members to represent GitLab at field marketing events include:
* Selecting qualifying BDRs and only SDRs as a last resort.
* Selecting team members that are certified for field marketing events by checking [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P7QvZ09F8OT7LJTeMRYbu6_Oxjw9UdouaJ5Oeo8SU8k/edit#gid=1715535840). Team members that are marked as "FM ready" have been tested to understand our sales amd value drivers. Only select team members that have been marked as "FM ready" with approval from sales development leadership.
* Have team members review [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRsiPIEXCAWi78sGGSu4BvSbRnxxkhEHZeoxnWsLn7c/edit) sheet before the event. This sheet includes information on our process to receive expense reimbursement and event ettiquite.
* Select applicable team members in a round robin manner. For instance, every available BDR gets invited to one event before a single BDR gets invited to a second, etc.

### Levels of Support
Support might include pre event outreach by BDR's to help drive attendance/meetings.  Also could include event booth staffing either in person or virtually by SDRs and/or BDRs.

### Joint Partner Related Events.
BDRs should not support joint partner related events where there the routing plan is to have the leads worked by the partner. Additionally, the following routing should be taken into the routing workflow.
* MQLs or Good/Hot leads related to BDR Actively Working Accounts + leads in qualifying status + leads active in sequence should not be passed to the partner but rather to the BDR Assigned or the current sales development lead owner.
* Any meetings booked at the event via Drift will automatically route to the SDR team.

### Routing nuances
* Any BDR 'Sales Nominated' prospects added to the campaign who respond to invite sequence will be worked by the BDR Assigned. If the account isn't in Actively Working status, they will be notified to move the account into Actively Working status so they can continue to work the engaged lead as well as begin strategic outreach to others at the account leveraging this compelling engagement.
* Drift meetings scheduled related to an Actively Working account will be facilited by the BDR Assigned. All others will route to the SDR org per the normal routing workflow.
* To test whether speed to lead increases conversion of event leads we will be moving High Priority campaign leads directly into BDR priority views with corresponding [SLA of 60 minute response time](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#lead-and-contact-views). Any campaign checked as High Priority will have any members that relate to Actively Working accounts marked as High Priority irregardless of their lead status. These will show up in the BDR's priority view.
* All other leads will route based on our normal routing workflow.

)

#### Field Process

When our Field Marketing Managers (FMMs) begin preparing for an event or campaign, they will create an issue using a [regional issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates). If they need BDR or SDR Support they will open an [SDR Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=ISR_SDR_FMTemplate) and the FMM will fill out/ensure the following sections are accurate:
* DRI's and Event details in the section: Field Marketing Brief and Pre-Event Request(s) Defined
* Pre-event/campaign goals
* Post-event/campaign goals
* Targets (title and number of attendees)

Once the sections are populated and up to date, the senior regional Sales Dev Manager is looped in. That senior regional Sales Dev Manager will assign a BDR manager to be the manager DRI for this event.

The BDR Manager DRI will:

* Select BDR(s) who will be involved in sourcing/attending the event/combination of both.
* Showcase who is assigned to which tasks and due dates based on the event date. (in the issue chart)
* Ensure that we hit our BDR support goals by communicating any gaps to other involved team managers
* Update issue with post-event reporting (# of folks sequenced post event, # of meetings booked
* Make sure pre and post sequences are created, reviewed by Sales Dev Ops, communicated to appropriate members of the team around the start/end dates.
* Update the issue grid to show which tasks have been completed by adding task metrics, i.e. # of sales nominated added and # of people added to pre-event invite sequence.
* If needed, communicate to wider team when there is any gap in plan.

The mentioned BDR(s) will:
* Read the issue to get an understanding of the event
* Complete any tasks under the ‘Pre-event/Post-event’ section based on the deadlines next to each bullet.
* Slack their manager and/or the FMM if they have questions.

#### Corporate Process
The corporate process is the same as the field process detailed above with the exception that they have a separate issue when looping in the Sales Development Organization for assistance that will link to the larger event issue.

#### Event Deadlines
**Event Promotion**

*  The BDR/SDR manager needs to be assigned a minimum of 45-days prior to the event, but the sooner they can start prepping, the better.
*  Related tasks to be completed by the BDR(s) involved can include: Sourcing net new leads, sequence creation and managing Sales Dev Ops approval, sequencing campaign members, event attendance
*  Related tasks to be completed by the BDR manager DRI: Populating the **High level Calendar View** of tasks due, monitoring and updating progress made in the **Tracking Goals** section , communication to other BDR(s) should there be potential for them to be involved
*  The BDR DRI manager(s) should have their teams begin compiling lists as soon as possible. Focus lists need to be completed three weeks prior to the event so that we will have three weeks of promotion
*  The BDR DRI lead needs to have their focus account list as well as the shared sequence completed, reviewed, and approved at least three weeks prior to the event so that we will have three weeks of promotion
*  **For strategic marketing campaigns categorized as direct mail or workshops, where there was BDR assistance in strategically driving attendence, we will ask marketing to import campaign MQLs and other designated "Hot" leads to the BDR assigned on the associated account.**

**Event Follow Up**

*  BDR project lead needs to have the follow up sequence cloned, revised and reviewed with management and FMM one week prior to the event. Other event sequences can be found in the FY24 Events/Campaigns Outreach collection. The copy doc for the event is linked in the event Epic and can be used for reference.
*  FMM will ensure leads from Field Marketing initiatives will be routed within 48 hours.
*  BDR Project lead should keep an eye on the [Event List Upload Slack Channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CQ8ADJMHT) for the announcement of the lead list upload. Once the leads are in SFDC, BDR Project lead to announce this and share the Outreach Sequence with the relevant BDR/SDR team Slack Channels dependent on the location of the event.

**Sequence Information**
- Please clone one of the Master Event Sequences found in the [Events Outreach collection](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences?direction=desc&order=recent&content_category_id%5B%5D=47) and pre-populate as many of the variables as possible. If all of the variables can be populated manually or through Outreach/Salesforce, change the email type from ‘manual’ to ‘auto.’ Work with your manager and the FMM to make any other additional adjustments that may be needed.

**White Glove Event Follow Up Sequence (SALs Included)**
- For more personal events, such as Executive Roundtables, there many be more detailed Last Event Notes that have an ask to include the people who interacted with the prospect at the event. For these situations we have a [specialized white glove sequence](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/12260). The goal of this sequence is to reach out to the prospect quickly and to include our SALs/AEs in the conversation.
- The first step is to put the prospect in [the Sequence](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/12260). From there customize the first email step to include the people mentioned in the Last Event Notes. You can also delay the time that the first email goes out so you have more time to get feedback from the SAL/AE if needed.
- Next send a screenshot of the first email step to the SAL/AE's that will be CC'd. Explain to them that this strategy creates space for them to engage with more specific messaging if the prospect is unresponsive. NOTE: There is a generic task on Day 12 to reach out to the SAL/SA if there has not been any engagement. The goal is to keep them in the loop and for you to work together to engage the prospect.

#### Outbound Campaign Process

[Process Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-5cQX3-aZ0)

BDRs have found particular success when organizing campaigns alongside regional Field Marketing Managers to ensure repeatable tactics and measurable results. The workflow below outlines what that process would entail should it be determined that you leverage this motion.

**Process Steps**

**Step 1:** Speak with your BDR Manager to identify the Field Marketing Manager (FMM) assigned to your SAL’s & AE's/Territory/Targeted Accounts. Set a meeting with the FMM to discuss existing Campaigns in motion, your ideas for Campaigns, and previously successful Campaigns (15-minute meeting over Zoom).
[Example of a Successful Campaign](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/field-marketing/-/issues/1750)

**Step 2:** Once you've identified a Campaign to launch, work closely with your FMM (FMM will create an Issue in GitLab related to the campaign), and then go into Salesforce Reporting to generate a targeted Contact list for the campaign.

**Workflow for creating a Salesforce report** (Screenshots below):
Go to Reports -> Create New -> Make a Report under Contacts & Accounts -> Add Field Filter Logic (BDR Assigned equals BDR Name, Contact Status does not contain Unqualified & Title Contains: Software Development, DevOps, Engineering, Security, Operations) -> Custom Date Range = from: last two years up to: the last two weeks and type in Last Interesting Moment into the field section and drag/drop the field into the Column Preview.-> Tip: - Organize your fields on the report to make it easier to read (First Name, Last Name, Account Name, Title, LIM, State, Country, Phone, Mobile, Email, Account Owner -> Run Report.

Please note, you can use this same Report workflow for generating a Lead Report. Simply select Leads from the New Report Options. Before you run the Report, please make sure that the Report Options -> Show is showing All Contacts/All Leads not My Contacts/My Leads by clicking the drop down and selecting All Contacts/Leads.

Save your Report by clicking the Save As tab. Make sure to Save Report under Business Development Representatives folder and add a Unique Report Name (see example)

Add Campaign name from SFDC Campaign that is listed in the Field Marketing BDR specific Issue. Example: 20200909_TShirtSurveyOutreachCa -> Member Status = Member -> Click Add.

Your Report for your FMM Campaign is now complete! Keep your Unique Report Name in mind for when you upload Report to Outreach (see Step 4).

**Step 3:** It's time to generate content for your Campaign in Outreach. Note, if the Campaign previously ran, use existing content (FMM will confirm). Otherwise, work with your FMM and BDR/SDR Manager to delegate the resources you need to create content for the Campaign.
[Outreach Campaign Example](https://app1a.outreach.io/sequences/5957?accounts-nonce=5583950dda94071d35e1)

**Step 4:** Bulk add Contacts or Leads pulled from Step 2 to the Campaign in Outreach (ensure Campaign content is revised and reviewed by BDR Manager and FMM).
**Workflow for Bulk Creating an SFDC Report in Outreach for Sequencing:**
In your Outreach 360 view, in the top left corner select Actions -> Select Bulk Create -> Select SFDC Report and type in your Unique Report Name

Select Next, then re-map any missing fields. Once Report is Uploaded and you are in Prospect View, select the Prospects you want to Add to Sequence and then add to the Campaign Sequence. You have now uploaded your Target Contact or Lead List SFDC Report into Outreach and Sequenced List into Campaign for Outbound prospecting!

**Step 5:** After Contacts or Leads are loaded into the appropriate Campaign Sequence, alert your Manager and FMM in the appropriate issue for review before activating (FMM approval recommended to start Campaign in Outreach).

**Step 6:** Check the Campaign daily in Outreach throughout the duration to ensure all tasks are completed. Provide updates in the Issue created in GitLab by the FMM related to the campaign (updates can include IQM conversion rate, Open rates, IQM to SAO conversion rates, etc.)

**Step 7:** Upon commencement of the Campaign, post a final update in the Issue that includes your results (updates can include the number of IQMs, Open rates, IQM to SAO conversion rates, etc.)

**Step 8:** Recommended to schedule 15-minute meeting with FMMs to recap the Campaign and provide feedback (this meeting can focus on final results, and if the Campaign should stop, continue, or be revisited in the future).

Optional Post Event Follow Up: Continue to monitor Contacts and Leads uploaded into the Campaign for lingering results (there are sometimes stragglers on Campaigns that respond after the Campaign has concluded). An easy way to monitor is setting one or two tasks in Outreach for 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the Campaign has concluded.


## PubSec AMER BDRs

The US PubSec team covers all US Agencies, US Government Contractors (Federal Systems Integrators), and US-based Universities. For interal questions about PubSec Lead routing, please contact Josh Downey.

A Federal Systems Integrator (FSI) is a private company whom requires US-based support and/or has 75% or more of their business coming from the Government. In the case that a commercial SDR/BDR comes across a company that may or may not meet this ROE because they do both Government and Commercial work, they should work with the FSI BDR to determine if it meets the ROE. If it is not possible to determine if it meets the criteria and the prospect is definitively discussing Government work, the Commercial SDR/BDR must air on the side of caution and let the FSI BDR handle the lead until the criteria can be determined.

The US PubSec team does not cover Universities, Agencies, and Contractors who are not based in the US. These prospects will be routed to the respective Commercial BDR/SDR covering that territory.

The PubSec BDRs will work closely with PubSec FMM's and MPM's on pre and post-event outreach. For events that are limited in attendance capacity, the PubSec ISRs & SALs will own pre and post-event strategy, not the BDR's.

[SDR PubSec Issue Board](//gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/1864446?label_name[]=SDR%20Pub%20Sec) - used to track relevant GitLab issues involving the PubSec BDR team. This is a global issue board and will capture all issues in any group/sub-group in the GitLab.com repo when any of the following scoped labels are used.


- `SDR Pub Sec`- Issues concerning the PubSec BDR team. When PubSec FMM's/MPM's add this tag to an event, these issues will appear on our board. When applicable, the PubSec BDR manager will create a BDR follow-up issue and relate it to the event issue so that marketing members can easily track our work.
- `SDR Pub Sec:: FYI` - Needs attention.
- `SDR Pub Sec:: In Progress` - Related work needed is in progress.
- `SDR Pub Sec:: Completed` - Related work is completed and ready for BDR manager to review/close.
- `SDR Pub Sec:: Revisiting` - Campaign is being revisited and additional outreach is being done.
- `SDR Pub Sec:: Josh FYI` - Issues pertaining specifically to Josh.


## Global Enterprise Land BDR Team
The Enterprise Land BDR team is responsible for creating qualified meetings and sales accepted opportunities with net new customers in the Large - Enterprise Segment. The team is composed of BDRs who focus on account-centric, persona-based outreach, strategic outbound prospecting, social selling, and creative outreach to educate and create internal champions that align with the GitLab value drivers and use cases.

### AMER Enterprise Land Alignment

AMER Enterprise BDRs are aligned by accounts - [see Salesforce report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aftz).

If you are trying to route a lead and the account is First Order Available and does NOT have an BDR Assigned on the account, please chatter Shamit Paul and she will assign to the BDR via round robin routing.

### EMEA Enterprise Land Alignment

| **Role**         |  **BDR**             |  **Lead & Account Assignments**      |
| :------------- |  :--------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| Northern Europe - Land       |  Kalyan Nathadwarawala   |  UKI   |
| NE & MEA - Land       |  Wasan Al-Nahi   |  UKI(Warren), Benelux(Nasser), Middle East, Africa  |

| Southern Europe - Land       |  Romain Santos   | France, Southern Europe  |
| DACH - Land       |  Christopher Allenfort   | DACH (Germany, Switzerland, Austria)  |

### Expectations

**Land BDR**

Named BDRs are responsible for:
* Leading account planning efforts and creating in-depth account plans for top focus accounts
* Qualifying and converting marketing-generated leads (MQLs) and inquiries into sales accepted opportunities (SAOs)
* Aligning prospecting efforts to the field, corporate, strategic and account based marketing campaigns
* Educating prospects and making positive impressions
* Generating awareness, meetings, and pipeline for sales
* Collaborating with peers, marketing, and sales teams

Requirements:
*  Meet monthly quota
*  Maintain a high sense of autonomy to focus on what's most important
*  Participate and lead planning, execution, and cross-functional meetings
*  Participate in initial qualifying meetings, discovery calls, and follow-up conversations
*  Maintain exceptional Salesforce hygiene, logging all prospecting activity, conversations, and account intelligence uncovered
*  Generate IACV Pipeline

### Working with Sales
BDRs and SDRs should be in regular communication with the SALs that they support. When taking on new accounts or supporting a new SAL, it is the responsibility of the  BDR/SDR to set up a kickoff call to:
1. Review the focus accounts
2. Gather actionable intelligence from SALs/AEs
3. Review outbound BDR plays, campaigns, field tactics, and other offers
4. Document the plan using docs, a spreadsheet, or the Sales Development quarterly issue plan

Recurring SAL<>BDR/SDR meetings can be scheduled or take place on an as-needed basis. As BDRs/SDRs are not directly aligned with SAL we encourage async updates as much as possible

Slack is encouraged for informal communication, but anything related to strategy, approach, or outreach should be documented.


### Geo BDR Account Prioritization Model

#### ICP - Ideal Customer Profile

* **High LAM** - High # of Estimated Dev Count left to purchase GitLab (you will need to consider the number in relation to employee size)
* **High DB QS** - High Demandbase Qualification Score (greater than 70)
* **SAL Insights** - Detail any SAL/AE given direction: sometimes found in Account Rank Notes/AE Notes fields
* **Persons with LIMs** - Uncover via Demandbase or SFDC reporting that there has been recent engagement from persons at account
* **Tech Used** - List technologies they use that signal they may be a good fit
* **Triggers** - List any compelling events or “Why’s” that signal this is a good time to reach out. If there are none, write “None”.

Please add the above ICP Notes to your Account Research Fields on Salesforce


#### Account Scoring & Prioritization

The next step after identifying all of the Net New focus accounts in a region is to prioritize them. The scoring model below should be used to determine the Priority level of the Net New Account which will help guide prioritization and prospecting efforts using the Outbound Prospecting Framework (below).

`Priority 1 Actively Working Accounts (15%)`
* Strong ICP Qualities
* Compelling Triggers
* Strategy is Tailored and Targeted
* Future based next step dates
* Specific next step notes

`Priority 2 Actively Working Accounts (35%)`
* ICP qualities
* No Triggers
* Strategy is Targeted (persona/industry based)
* Future based next step dates updated weekly/bi-weekly
* Next step notes should just include week #

`Priority 3 Actively Working Accounts (50%)`
* ICP qualities
* No Recent Triggers
* Strategy is nurture based
* Future based next step dates updated monthly
* Next step notes should just include recent release # or event invite


**Other Good Account Scoring Qualifiers:**
*  Current CE Usage
*  250+ employees in IT/TEDD positions
*  Good Fit Industry / Vertical (High Growth, Technology, Financial, Healthcare, Regulated Business)
*  Early Adopters / Innovative IT Shops (Identifiers & Keywords): Kubernetes / Containers, Microservices, Multi-cloud, DevOps, DevSecOps, CICD (and open-source + proprietary tools), SAST / DAST, Digital Transformation
*  Current DevOps Adoption (multiple DevOps roles on staff or hiring for multiple DevOps positions)

**Outbound Prospecting Framework**

| **Priority Level**        |  **Account Strategy Includes**                 | **Next Step Date**      | **Next Step Notes**      |
| :---------- |  :----------                  | :----------------- | :----------------------|
| Priority 1   |    Priority #, Any Details         |      Future based next steps      | Hyper-personalized, simultaneous outreach, creative, direct mail, ads, groundswell, events |
| Priority 2   |  Priority #, Weekly Plan or Length of Sequence          |      Future based next steps depending on account strategy      | Include the weeks outreach and overall strategy|
| Priority 3 |  Priority #             | Update Next Step Date to next months outreach         | BDR Next Step, What kind of nurture (Product Updates, Events, Ect) |

Examples of the Outbound Prospecting Framework [Can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5unjpSTYQFENlfheUi6_ZNV2fbrIqQjxNBqtwhEaYw/edit#slide=id.g10be0957fec_0_488)


## Global Enterprise Expand BDR Team
The Global Enterprise Expand BDR team is responsible for creating qualified meetings, sales accepted opportunities, and pipeline within existing customer accounts (Accounts with total CARR in parent/children/subsidiaries in a hierarchy) in the Large - Enterprise Segment.
The team is composed of BDRs who focus on strategic account-based, persona-based outreach, strategic outbound prospecting, social selling, and creative outreach to create and expand internal champions that align with the [GitLab value drivers](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/#customer-value-drivers) and use cases.
The aim for the BDR is to find new business units within these customer account hierarchies who are looking to move from a competitor/GitLab Core/CE to a paid version of GitLab.
SALs alone are responsible for renewing/uptiering existing paid customer instances to a higher paid version of the product, eg from Standard to Premium.

### How GitLab defines a customer

Account alignment is based on the ultimate parent. If any account within the ultimate parent hierarchy is a customer and has a `Total CARR` amount of $48 or over, then the entire hierarchy is considered a customer and worked by the Expand team.

Total CARR of $48 and below is deemed as a Land Account and these accounts are flagged with a check mark in the `First Order Available` field on the account object.

Accounts with no check in the box fall to the Expand team.

## Expand and Territory Alignments


### AMER Enterprise Expand Alignment

AMER Enterprise BDR Expand Team is aligned to account territories in US West and US East regions. Each region has verified Growth scores/CARR per territory that help determine the equitable spread of BDR alignments as shown below. Target accounts are based on SAL strategy, potential CARR, Intent data (propensity to buy), and industry.

In case of any AE requests for outbounding, the go-to BDRs above are briefed to incorporate these requests to their pipeline as a priority.

## Expectations

### Expand BDRs are responsible for:

- Accounts with their name in the `BDR Assigned` field
- Leading account planning efforts with SALs/CSMs/ISRs and creating in-depth account plans for top focus expand accounts and other accounts in their hierarchy
- Qualifying and converting marketing-generated leads (MQLs) and inquiries into sales accepted opportunities (SAOs)
- Aligning their outbound/inbound prospecting efforts to field/corporate/strategic/account based marketing campaigns
- Educating prospects and making positive impressions
- Generating/Expanding GitLab awareness, meetings, and ARR pipeline for sales
- Collaborating with peers, marketing, and sales teams


### Requirements:

- Maintain a high sense of autonomy to focus on what's most important
- Participate in lead planning, execution, and cross-functional meetings
- Participate in initial qualifying meetings, discovery calls, and follow-up conversations
- Maintain exceptional Salesforce hygiene, logging all prospecting activity, conversations and account intelligence uncovered, including LinkedIn conversations and calls as well as emails.


## Working with Sales
Expand BDRs should prioritize communication with the SALs within territories they are aligned to. BDRs will organize and schedule a kickoff call to:
- Review the focus expand accounts (including all children/subsidiaries of over 500 employees)
- Gather actionable intelligence from SALs/CSMs/ISRs and discuss key expand strategy
- Research the account with the SALs/CSMs/ISRs, see if LinkedIn introductions can be made
- Research the account on LISN and select 10 - 15 contacts who follow GitLab or who fall into the personas we target
- Review outbound BDR plays, campaigns, field tactics, and other offers
- Review [Outreach persona sequences](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#outbound-messaging) with SAL:
- Document the plan using docs, a spreadsheet, and/or the BDR quarterly issue plan

Recurring SAL|BDR meetings can be scheduled or take place on an as-needed basis.

Slack is encouraged for informal communication (team slack channel), however, anything related to strategy, approach, or outreach should be documented.

## Expansion Strategies, Account Ranking, and Rules of Engagement

### Strategies:
- Growth within an existing customer account: BDR should strategically partner with SAL/ISR to identify additional business units to bring into the conversation as growth opportunities. Renewal dates should be exploited.
- Expansion into parent/children/subsidiaries of existing customer accounts: These are accounts that fall within the corporate hierarchy within Salesforce. If a child/subsidiary account is identified via ZoomInfo but not in our system, then BDR should follow the following process:
Create a LEAD for that account and then convert to CONTACT to create the ACCOUNT when you qualify your first lead.
- Free to paid upgrades: Existing Core/CE users can be targeted to upgrade to a paid version of GitLab

### [Ranking](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#definitions-for-enterprise-account-ranking) and prioritization of accounts:
- Rank 1: Expand with Purpose (EwP) accounts should be closely/strategically worked with SALs. These accounts have High Demandbase intent scores and should therefore be High touch by BDR.
- Rank 2: ICP Ultimate parent accounts that have Core/CE-Users in a hierarchy, Total CARR/LAM for account, Med/Low Demandbase intent scores, and small renewals in current FQ.
- Rank 3: As above but are not our ICP

### Professional Services Opportunities

A **Professional Services Opportunity** will be used to cover any integration, consulting, training or other service that a Sales rep will sell to a prospect/client and needs or wants to be invoiced separately. To invoice separately a new quote and opportunity must be created.

More information on the steps needed to create a Professional Services Opp can be [found here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#creating-a-professional-services-opportunity)


### Sourcing Process
The manager will create a list of their focus area and criteria similar to what's outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oOzjd2j8trQLU_5h_oiBbyg-saRMe-TA8HTDBuiPuEM/edit?usp=sharing).
Past Business Development Representatives have shared their best practice steps related to the sourcing process [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzRFJlSDdU9Y39d5j6pkFl4i_lyEs9EONQSF14ZcnSM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Sales Dev Org Trouble Shooting and Frequently Asked Questions FAQ

* **I can't see certain Outreach collections!**: You potentially were added to the incorrect Sales Dev Team in Outreach. Please reach out to Sales Dev Operations.
* **My version of Salesforce seems very basic...**: Make sure you are using the Sales version of Salesforce. To check, please go to the top right corner of your Salesforce window and click the blue button with the drop down window. From there select "Sales".
* **I have not recieved access to all of my tools and it has been a week**: Notify your manager and have them comment on your Onboarding Role Entitlements Issue.
* **I have uploaded more leads from ZoomInfo than what are showing up in my Salesforce ZoomInfo Lead View**: This most likely due to these leads aleady being in our Salesforce. The problem is that they are listed as a contact in Salesforce and will only appear in your ZoomInfo Contacts view rather than your Zoominfo Lead view.
* **I do not know what this person did to score as an MQL**: First check the last interesting moment description on Salesforce and then check the Scoring tab of the Marketo Sales Insight widget that is also on the Salesforce lead page. If no points were allocated to behavior and only to demographic type information please Slack the Marketing Ops group so they are aware that this lead did not take any new action.
* **I received a personal data subject request by a prospect**: Our MOPs team has set up a process to address any data subject requests for deletion or access to data. If you receive a request for deletion or access to data, please re-direct inquiries to the [Personal Data Subject Request](https://support.gitlab.io/account-deletion/). This messaging snippet [can be used and tailored.](https://app1a.outreach.io/snippets/1903)
* **Why are BDRs no longer the Account Owner in Outreach?**: BDRs are no longer listed as the account Owner in Outreach to improve Sales Dev and Sales visibility across all prospects/accounts (excluding PubSec). If you want to filter to see just your accounts, please use the  ‘BDR Assigned’ field.
* **A prospect said they were going to buy through our website (known as a Web Direct). How can I tell if they did?**: SDRs get credit for opportunities where the SDR had meaningful two way communication with a prospect shortly before they bought GitLab through our website. The best way to search for a web direct opportunity is to use [this report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004dkX4). First, set the date range to the time you think the prospect would have bought. Next, find the opportunity that is tied to your prospect's account. Then follow [this process](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#how-do-i-request-sao-credit-on-a-web-direct-opportunity) to request SAO credit.
    * Note: Sometimes someone else from your prospect's company actually made the GitLab purchase, leading to the opportunity being related to them instead

## Sales Development Organization Time Off

While we have a "no ask, must tell" PTO policy we ask that, in accordance with the [Time Off Policy](/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off), you give your manager a heads up early of your intended time off so that they can help arrange cover for your tasks, if necessary. We want to help our team members being able to [fully unplug from work](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/mental-health-awareness-learning-path/#part-1-your-mental-health-matters) during their PTO, while not having to worry about their workload or target attainment. Based on this, we have created this PTO Territory Planning Issue that you can use to strategize your work and be aligned to the GitLab value of being a [Manager of One](/handbook/leadership/#managers-of-one).

To help BDRs and SDRs who are on PTO please review [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDzeqbd0Jes) on how to sequence on behalf of your teammembers.

Please also review [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsJBP4-WIBk&ab_channel=GitLabUnfiltered) on how to clone a teammates B1 or S1 lead view in order to sequence MQL leads for them.

To log a PTO Territory Planning request, please go to the Issue list on the SDR GitLab project [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new#) and choose `PTO_Planning_Issue` from the `Description` drop-down list.

## Making Changes to the GitLab Handbook (for BDRs and SDRs)

[Video Walkthrough of how to make changes to the GitLab Handbook for the Sales Development org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Nv7bzksiY&t=1032s)

One of our Values is being [handbook first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/). In order to align the SDR organization more closely to this ideal, below are suggested steps. Please remember that the Handbook is a living document, and you are strongly encouraged to make improvements and add changes. This is ESPECIALLY true when it comes to net new solutions that should be shared so the whole organization has access to that process. (aka The DevOps ideal of turning "Localized Discoveries" into "Global Knowledge".)

Steps:

1. Have a change you want to make to the handbook? Great!
2. Navigate to the source code of the page in the handbook (e.g. [Link to edit the SDR page in the Handbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/source/handbook/marketing/sales-development/index.html.md) )
3. Click either "Edit" or "Web IDE" to make your changes.
4. Have a brief but descriptive "Commit message" (e.g. "Add new section on 'How to Make Changes to the Handbook'") and commit your changes
5. Fill out the Merge Request details


## Working with 3rd Parties (resellers, partners, consulting firms, and/or companies that buy GitLab for their customers)
**The end-user account determines the BDR/SDR alignment:** If you are the SDR assigned to the 3rd party lead, please gather the information in point 1 and pass the lead to the correctly assigned BDR (the BDR assigned to the end-user account) who will complete points 2-6

1.  Gather billing and end-user details from the reseller:
    * Billing company name/address:
    * Billing company contact/email address:
    * End-user company name/address:
    * End-user contact/email address:
    * [Snippet in outreach](https://app1a.outreach.io/snippets)
2. Create a new lead record with end-user details
    *  Ensure that all notes are copied over to the new LEAD as this is the LEAD that will be converted.
3. Converting the new lead
    * Name opp to reflect reseller involvement as shown here: “End-user account name via reseller account name”
4. Convert original reseller lead to a contact associated with the reseller account
    *  If an account does not already exist for the reseller, create one when converting the lead to a contact.
    *  Assign the record to the same account owner
    *  Do NOT create a new opportunity with this lead.
5. Attach activity to the opportunity
    * On the reseller contact, go to the activity and link each activity related to your opportunity to the opp.
        * Activity History > click edit to the left of the activity > choose 'opportunity' from the 'related to' dropdown > find the new opportunity > save
6. Update the opportunity
    * Change the business type to new business and stage to pending acceptance.
    * Under contacts, add the reseller contact, role as reseller, and primary contact.
    * Under partners, add the reseller account as VAR/Reseller"

## Working with the Community Relations Team
The [Community Relations team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/) owns GitLab's [Education](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/education-program/), [Open Source](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/opensource-program/), and [Startups](/solutions/startups/) programs. When a lead fills out the form to apply for one of these free community programs, Salesforce `Lead` ownership will automatically change to the `Community Advocate Queue`. If this Lead was in an Outreach sequence, it will automatically be marked as finished.

The [Community Programs team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/) (a sub-team of Community Relations), and the Program Managers for each program, will then work to qualify the lead. If the Lead does not end up qualifying for one of the programs, they will be passed straight to sales.
