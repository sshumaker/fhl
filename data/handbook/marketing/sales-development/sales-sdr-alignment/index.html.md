## Purpose / Objective

The purpose of the **Global Sales-SDR Alignment Framework** is to provide an outbound guideline that helps identify goals, provide better alignment, and highlight expectations for the following roles:

1. Marketing: [Sales Development Representative](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/marketing/sales-development-representative/) (SDR)
1. Sales: [Strategic Account Leader](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/strategic-account-leader/) (SAL)
1. Sales: [Account Executive](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/account-executive/) (AE)
1. Sales: [Inside Sales Representative](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/public-sector-inside-account-representative/) (ISR)

The alignment framework is designed to facilitate a successful relationship between SDRs and Sales ensuring both are properly positioned to achieve their goals.

The [Territories Mapping File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gElhORjqraKDMQnWzApPelyP_vVa24tAOA85vb5f3Uc/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=117649236165967789679) is the Single Source of Truth for ownership by segments, territories, and teams. All teams should use this SSOT to ensure alignment on who is responsible for what.

### Expectations and Strategic Processes

#### Weekly Outbound BDR-Sales Sync Meeting

This weekly meeting is critical to drive and ensure alignment between teams.
- Historically, our SDR/Sales pairings who have incorporated this meeting into their week have been the most successful at driving new pipeline.
- Agenda:
     1. Review accounts added to Actively Working status past week.
          - The field `Actively Working Start Date` can be used to sort reports.
     2. Ensure that there's alignment on messaging/prospecting customisation for new OB accounts.
          - The fields `Account Research` and `Account Strategy` fields are to be used.
     3. Review progress on accounts currently in pipeline.
          - The field `BDR Next Step Date` can be used to sort for action items.

##### 1:1 collateral

The resources below are meant to be cloned and customized, and to be used to structure OB collaboration in 1:1s. Accounts in the BDR organisation are prioritized based [on the guidelines here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5unjpSTYQFENlfheUi6_ZNV2fbrIqQjxNBqtwhEaYw/edit#slide=id.g11de9359282_0_12) while [the handbook page here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/sales-development/#bdr-outbound-process) shares more detail in the BDR org's process.
