## General leadership principles
This page will serve as a training resource and operational guide for current and future managers. All Sales Development Managers should follow the [general leadership
principles](/handbook/leadership/) set out in the handbook. 

- [1-1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)
- [Providing regular feedback](/handbook/leadership/#giving-feedback)
- [Dealing with underperformance](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/)

## Manager Onboarding
Onboarding is essential for all Sales Development Managers at GitLab. As part of onboarding, a [Becoming a GitLab Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/becoming-a-gitlab-manager.md) issue will be created for each manager when they join, or are promoted. This issue is intended to connect new managers with the crucial information they need, and ensure they have access to all the resources and training available.

### Outbound BDR Process Manager Onboarding

The BDR process that we have defined here in GitLab is meant to provide a repeatable set of steps that an outbound BDR can follow to achieve results. It is very important for an onboarding manager to align themselves as quickly as possible to this process as it is a proven method that will help them manage their team in a efficient and data-driven way. 

The BDR Process is explained step-by-step in the [main SDR handbook page here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#bdr-outbound-process)

For a newcoming manager, we provide the [Watch and Help Dashboards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/sdr-manager-resources/#tracking--monitoring-resources) that will be your main tool in understanding where your team is aligned to our BDR process, and where they need assistance. 

To help structure your usage of the above, you can follow the steps below during your first month at GitLab while [the document here will be your main go-to resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18k1_jDHVgNzy2SzcPZ7GAOdJ6zb9i37Z4-V1-dEFKiU/edit#)

| Action | Benefit | 
| ------ | ------- | 
| Clone the W&H Dashboard and edit each report to be exclusive to your team's names | Gives you a SSoT that you and your team can easily reference | 
| Review the dashboard with your team, and discuss how the data on it connect to the [BDR KPIs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/revenue-marketing/sdr/#sdrbdr-roe-and-inbound-lead-management) | Allows you to understand your team's level of maturity and each team member's current level of alignment to existing processes |
| Take note of any discrepancies or points of feedback from the team, either transcribe them to 1:1s for individual conversations or to the SDR Issue board for org-wide improvements | Enables you to filter between discrepancies that are caused because of a team member's lack of diligence that should be improved upon by the individual OR for discrepancies that were caused by an org-wide operational shortcoming that should be improved upon on a global scale. |
| Set realistic expectations with the team about adherance to org KPIs and set a review mechanism to go over them on a reccuring basis | Helps maintain a repeatable structure of accountability for your entire team |

## "Actively Working" Status Related Demandbase Reports

**[BDR Assigned Actively Working -](https://web.demandbase.com/o/d/a/l/261170/su)**

* Managers can clone and add their teams into BDR Assigned field so that they can run analytics to find any accounts showing recent intent.
* They can subscribe to weekly snapshot.
* They can coach their team to clone as a personal report and create subscription.

**[BDR Assigned Not in Actively Working -](https://web.demandbase.com/o/d/a/l/261160/l)**
* Managers can clone and add their teams into BDR Assigned field so that they can run analytics to find any accounts showing recent intent via engagement, pricing page etc.
* They can edit columns so that they can see which accounts have high qualification/ predict score/ activity level (product usage) indicating that they may need to be moved into AWA.
* They can subscribe to weekly snapshot.
* They can coach their team to clone as a personal report and create subscription. (Will need to check [MQL date persons list](https://web.demandbase.com/o/d/p/l/261084/l) to make sure that account hasn't had MQL within last 30 days. If it has, they can put into Queued status and note in next step date when to move into AW.)

**[BDR Actively Working Accounts w/No Active Sequence or Qualifying Status -](https://web.demandbase.com/o/d/a/l/261374/l)**
* Managers can clone for their team and add BDR assigned selectors with their team members in ruleset. This will allow them to see/coach to possible accounts that need to be worked or removed from actively working status.
* They can run analytics on this list to see if there has been any recent engagement on these accounts where there may not be outreach going on.
* They can coach their team to clone as a personal report and create subscription to stay on top of sequencing folks at Actively Working accounts.

## Onboarding
GitLab People Connect Team members will [create the onboarding issue](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#timing) and start completing the onboarding tasks, no later than one week before the new team member joins. People Connect Team members require a minimum of 4 business days (with the new hire timezone as the basis) before the new hire's start date to complete all onboarding tasks. This issue will be automatically assigned to you. As a manager, you will [also have tasks](/handbook/people-group/general-onboarding/#managers-of-new-team-members) that need to be completed prior to the new team member's start date. 

The general onboarding issue will also automatically add a ['Sales Development' section](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/employment-templates/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/onboarding_tasks/department_sales_development.md) under 'Job Specific Tasks' based on the role of the new SDR. Both you and your new hire will have tasks to complete in this section. 

With the creation of this issue, an [access request (AR) will also be automatically created](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_sales_development) for a new team member on their second day at GitLab. This AR lists the role based entitlements (pre-defined groups and system-level access that are granted automatically to team members depending on their role) your new hire will need.
     *See what is being auto provisioned on this AR [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/role_baseline_access_request_tasks/department_demand_generation). 

### New Hire's First Day
On your new hire's first day, the assigned People Connect Team member will [schedule a welcome email](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#day-1-onboarding-tasks) to arrive at 7:30am (local time of the new team member) on their start date detailing how your new hire can access GitLab and begin their onboarding process. 

### Manager Onboarding Checklist
##### Prior to Day 1
* Complete â€˜Managerâ€™ tasks on the onboarding issue *Note: there are tasks to complete prior to your new hire starting
* Schedule a welcome call at the start of your new hireâ€™s first day to discuss:
     * Main focus should be completing as much of your onboarding as possible.
     * When you have available time feel free to move ahead as some onboarding task lists for the day won't take you all day.
     * How to manage meeting invites in your inbox (there are a ton!)
     * You will receive numerous emails in their first two weeks asking you to register or activate your license to a specific tool we use, please go ahead and do all of this.
     * What you can expect in regards to [onboarding at GitLab as an SDR](/handbook/marketing/sales-development/sdr-playbook-onboarding/)
    
##### After new hire has started

* Complete remaining â€˜Managerâ€™ tasks on the onboarding issue
* Set up [1:1s](/handbook/leadership/1-1/)

## Internal Team Transition
If an SDR or a group of SDRs will be moving from one SDR team to another, please open [this SDR internal transition template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/sdr/-/issues/new?issuable_template=sdr_internal_team_change) as the automatic people ops issue does NOT get created for this type of transition. Please complete the steps in this issue to ensure the SDR changing teams has everything they need.

## Leave of Absence
If an SDR will be out for a prolonged period of time, please follow the proper processes and complete the SDR leave checklist.
- [Parental Leave](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave)
- [Emergency Situations](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-time-off-for-emergency-situations)
- [Unpaid leave](/handbook/paid-time-off/#unpaid-leave-of-absence)

### Manager Sales Development Leave Checklist
- Submit a [LeanData change request issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leandata_change_sdralignment) to ensure leads will be worked and Drift conversations will reroute to another member of your team during this time. In the additional information section detail the starting date and date of return. Try to give MktgOps a minimum of a weeks notice. 
- Work with your SDR to clean up tasks and mark sequences as finished or pause if needed. 

Similar to onboarding, there is a role-specific tasks section that will automatically be populated for the Sales Development team. This section includes tasks for the new manager and sales operations that must be filled out to ensure proper alignment, routing and reporting.  

## Offboarding
The full process for offboarding at GitLab differs based on whether it is voluntary or involuntary. These processes can be found on the [offboarding handbook page](/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#offboarding). 

### Manager Offboarding Checklist

* The people team will create an [offboarding issue](/handbook/people-group/offboarding/#offboarding), complete all â€˜Managerâ€™ tasks on the issue. If you have any questions use the #managers #people-connect slack channels. You can also reach out to the assigned people ops team member on the issue. 
* Create and submit an issue using [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/marketing-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=leandata_change_sdralignment) to inform Marketing Operations of who will be covering this territory and when that will start.
