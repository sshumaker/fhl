description: "Everything you need to know about suggesting and publishing a post on GitLab's blog."
---

Welcome to the GitLab blog handbook! The [GitLab blog](/blog/) is managed by [the Editorial team](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/content/editorial-team/). The managing editor of the blog is Sandra Gittlen (@sgittlen).

## We're looking for technical content!
Engineering-driven content performs very well on our blog, so if you have an idea, please ping @sgittlen on Slack. We're eager to showcase all the technical how-to and deep-dive content we can.

## Turnaround time
Our "SLA": The blog team will review all blog post "pitches" within two business days and get back to you with suggestions/go-forward approval. Once a blog draft is received, our goal is to edit _urgent posts_ within one business day and non-urgent posts within three business days. All blog posts must be reviewed by legal, and that could add time to process, just to set expectations. 

If you're just looking for feedback on an idea, Slack us for a same-day turnaround.

And, if you're an edge case not covered by the above, please Slack @sgittlen.

Publishing of blog posts occurs according to an editorial calendar. However, that is subject to change based on news/information that needs to be posted. The blog team will update authors as to their expected publish dates.

## Blog publishing goals
Volume of posts: We'd like to publish at least 20 blog posts a month but even in a crazy busy month we'll more than likely be able to find a place for your post, so, please send us your ideas and let us worry about the scheduling.

Traffic from posts: Ideally every post we publish should support our goal of driving traffic to the website. We apply SEO best practices to posts. It's a combination of art, science, and (sometimes) luck, and we do our best to maximize the page views each post will receive.  

## Communication
- Chat channels; use `#content` for questions, see `#content-updates` for updates on most recently published articles.

## Who can publish content to the GitLab blog?

[Everyone can contribute at GitLab](/company/mission/#mission). For the blog, this means we welcome your blog suggestions, ideas, and drafts. However, the [main blog](/blog) is one of the many official voices of GitLab – meaning content that is published there must be carefully vetted to ensure we are accurately representing GitLab – both the company and the product. The editorial team, which manages the blog, is tasked with this responsibility.

The editorial team members are the [directly responsible individuals (DRI) for the official GitLab blog](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) – anyone can give input, but the editorial team will ultimately decide.

## How to suggest a blog post

The first step in publishing a blog is to open an issue in [gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/new?issuable_template=blog-post) using the `Blog post` template. Include a short summary of your proposed blog post where indicated, and ping @Sgittlen.

If your post is time-sensitive, please ping @sgittlen on Slack. Otherwise the editorial team will reach out to you to discuss timing. 

1. Feel free to start your draft using this [blog post template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TavHlYbHQ8U1C82TEzcYaLS9l0sm89jEcBNQ0gBgkcw/edit) which has all the relevant information already embedded. Then see the [formatting guidelines](#formatting-guidelines) for help with creating and formatting your blog post MR.
1. Use the `Blog post` merge request template for your MR and ensure it is set to close the associated issue automatically.
1. Assign the issue and associated merge request to yourself and apply the appropriate labels based on what stage of creation you are on. Once it's ready for editorial review, assign both to Editorial team member who reviewed your pitch.

### Is your blog post an announcement?

First, please see [If you want to share news/an update or are seeking feedback](#-if-you-want-to-share-newsan-update-or-are-seeking-feedback) to check if you need to open an announcement request issue.

If you have already followed those directions in the [PR handbook](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/#requests-for-external-announcements) and the Corporate Communications and Editorial teams have decided that a blog post is the best way to communicate your announcement, please follow the process below.

### Disclosure process for posts concerning third parties

When proposing or requesting a blog post on a topic that concerns one of GitLab's business partners, it may be appropriate to seek feedback from the partner before publishing. If you are planning a blog post that discusses a partner in depth and you're not sure if it's appropriate to seek partner feedback, please ping a member of the [Partner Marketing](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/) team on your issue for their input. If they think the feedback process is necessary, please follow the steps below.

**1. Connect with Alliances**

When brainstorming what topic to discuss and write about, loop in a partner manager from Alliances for feedback and buy-in during the 'ideation phase'.  To check who the relevant partner manager is, share your blog post issue and ask in the #Alliances Slack channel.

At this stage you and Alliances can decide whether or not the blog post topic justifies seeking feedback from the partner in question. If so, please submit your draft blog post MR to the Editorial team for review a **_minimum_ of 5 working days before you plan to publish** to ensure enough time for all parties to review.

**2. Submit draft to partner for feedback**

When the merge request has been reviewed by the Editorial team, please assign the blog post MR and associated issue to the partner manager to submit the draft to our partners for review while CC'ing the appropriate stakeholders from marketing for visibility. This should be done with 48 hours' courtesy notice, for the sole purpose of providing feedback on the following areas:

- Accuracy and appropriate representation of the partner in the context of the blog
- Accuracy of the technical components of the blog. (i.e., If we're using the wrong CLI command or stating something inaccurate about their service/product offering)
- The headline, only in cases where the partner or their product or services are named in the headline

We should not proceed to publish the blog post until the partner manager has received the feedback and/or has received acknowledgment from the partner that they have read the draft within the 48-hour window. 

### Joint announcements

Joint announcements with partners or other third parties should first be [proposed to the Corporate Communications team](/handbook/marketing/corporate-communications/#requests-for-external-announcements) ahead of writing to maximize impact and ensure alignment across teams. They will decide whether we issue a press release, blog post, or communicate via other channels. If they decide to move forward with a blog post, please ping @sgittlen.

### Guest posts by GitLab partners

Official [GitLab partners](/partners/) may use our [CTA button](#call-to-action) and include promotional copy, however the blog post must still serve a function (informational or educational) other than simply promoting something.

For either type of guest post, the process and guidelines for publishing are as follows:

1. Create an issue in the [www-gitlab-com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) project and label it `blog-post` and `guest/partner post`.
2. If technical input is required, we will ask for instructions from the third party; otherwise it is at the discretion of the blog editorial and technical writing teams whether or not to go forward.

### Guest posts by non-partners

If the author of a guest post is not an official GitLab partner, they may link back to their website or own content with inline links, but may not include a [CTA button](#cta) or promotional copy.

#### If you see a story we should feature on our blog

If you spot a tweet, post, or feedback anywhere detailing an interesting use case for GitLab which you think could make a good story, open an issue and ping @nwoods to help determine whether we should pursue an interview for a blog post or case study (we will not ask the original author to create something for us).

### Is your blog post SAFE?

GitLab is a maturing company, and while transparency remains a core value, we are considering what information falls under "Internal Transparency" and what falls under "External Transparency". The Editorial team has the responsibility of making sure that all blog content is consistent with our **SAFE** guidelines. Below is a summary of the [SAFE guidelines created by our legal team](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/):

**1. Sensitive:** "The S in SAFE serves as a reminder to make sure that Team Members are not sharing information which could be considered Sensitive information without express approval from GitLab Legal."

Example: Does this blog post contain confidential company information, customer or partner information, or information about the security or stability of GitLab's platform?

**2. Accurate:** "The A in SAFE serves as a reminder to double-check that the information Team Members are sharing is Accurate."

Example: Can you cite the information shared in this blog post? Is this information verifiable if challenged by an external party?

Remember: "Not only should Team Members make sure that the information is Accurate, but they should be able to provide the underlying data, if applicable, to support the accuracy or confirm the methodology used to achieve the data."

Fix this by attributing data or information to a source.

**3. Financial**: "The F in SAFE serves as a reminder that the company’s Financial information is so important to protect that it requires CFO’s approval prior to sharing externally."

Example: Does your blog post contain any financial information, such as dollars, performance metrics, or margins? Does the information you are about to share include any **forward-looking statements**? This includes quantitative (something that CAN be expressed as a number) and qualitative (something that CANNOT be expressed as a number) statements.

**4. Effect:** "The E in SAFE serves as a reminder to be mindful about the Effect - intentional and unintentional - that the information Team Members are sharing may have on the company."

Example: Does your blog post contain information that could be helpful or harmful to the company or team members? What effect could the information contained in your blog post have on the "information mix" available to the public?

Remember: "When considering what information to disclose, Team Members should consider the pros and cons of the Effect the information will have on all parties inside and outside the company. Furthermore, Team Members should also consider that in some instances information intended to have one Effect may have a completely different, unintended Effect. When in doubt, talking it over with a colleague or reaching out via #safe is always a good option."

#### What does this mean for my blog post?

GitLab has a bias for action, and the Editorial team is no different. However, the GitLab Blog is a public-facing asset and represents the company. If the Editorial team has concerns or questions about the information contained in the blog post, the **Editorial team members have the authority to hold a blog post** until Legal, Corporate Commmunications, Partner Marketing, the CMO, etc., can review the blog post to mitigate any potential risk for the company.

Learn more about the [SAFE Guidelines by reading the handbook page](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/).

### Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) checklist for blog writers

It is important that our blog content represents our company values of diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Not all of these points will be relevant to your blog post, but they are important values and practices to be mindful of throughout the writing process. The blog editorial team tries to check for these things, but it is better if all content is created with these values and practices in mind. Tag us if you have questions!

#### Inclusive formatting

- Did you select an [inclusive](/handbook/marketing/blog/#inclusive-photos) cover image and/or screengrab?
- Write descriptive alternative text for all [inline images and screengrabs](/handbook/marketing/blog/#inline-images). Alternative text is important for SEO and accessibility. Read this [article from Moz to learn more about writing alternative text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text).
- Ensure that all links are meaningful and descriptive (e.g. avoid link text such as "read here" or "this article"). Descriptive links are more useful and accessible for people using screen readers.

#### Inclusive writing

- Write short and concise sentences. Clear writing with short sentences makes it easier for the reader to follow along.
- Limit your use of jargon, and if you must use a jargon-y term, define it on the first instance.
- GitLab is a global team with a global community, so you want to write for a global audience. This means limiting your use of regional metaphors and not writing in a manner that is United States-centric.
- Does the post use [inclusive language](/company/culture/inclusion/#inclusive-language)? An example of inclusive language: "Hi folks/Hi everyone/ Hi y'all" versus "Hi guys".
- If you're still not sure about your use of inclusive language (or just want to check to be sure) test it out against the [inclusiveness check tool](https://inclusiveness-check.herokuapp.com/) developed by GitLab team member, [Lien Van Den Steen](/company/team/#lienvdsteen). Here's [how the tool works](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/peopleops-eng/people-operations-engineering/-/issues/72) and the [words it checks against are listed in the linked project](https://gitlab.com/lienvdsteen/linter/-/tree/master/data).
- Is every individual in the blog post quoted using their [preferred pronoun](/handbook/people-group/orientation-identity/#how-do-i-know-which-pronouns-to-use)? Tip: If you don't know someone's preferred pronoun, just ask them. It should also be included on the [team page profile](/company/team/#close-modal) and Slack profile.

### More DIB writing tips

- Is your blog post biased? We all have unconscious biases. Take our [recognizing bias training](/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/#recognizing-bias-training), check the [list of unconscious biases in our DIB handbook page](/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/#unconscious-biases-to-look-out-for-in-ourselves-and-in-others) and practice strategies for [recognizing and managing yours](/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/#tips-on-recognizing-and-avoiding-bias).
- If you still have questions, don't hesitate to tag the editorial team lead @sgittlen, leads of the appropriate [team member resource group (TMRG)](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/) in your blog issue, or email diversityinclusionandbelonging@gitlab.com with your questions.

## Formatting guidelines

To publish to the blog, you will need to create a merge request for the www-gitlab-com project with a file of your blog post content formatted in Markdown. There are a few ways to go about this outlined [below](#when-youre-ready-to-create-your-blog-post). **If you choose to use Netlify CMS you likely won't need to know all the formatting in this section so feel free to [skip ahead](#when-youre-ready-to-create-your-blog-post).**

Please read through the [Markdown guide](/handbook/markdown-guide/) for reference.

If you like, you can start by drafting your post in a Google Doc (feel free to make a copy of this [blog post template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TavHlYbHQ8U1C82TEzcYaLS9l0sm89jEcBNQ0gBgkcw/edit)). Below are instructions for formatting the content of your file correctly. If you already have your content ready to go, you can jump ahead to see [how to add your blog post file with a merge request](#when-youre-ready-to-create-your-blog-post).

### Frontmatter

The post **frontmatter** is the first part of any post. It is standard and cannot be changed, so please make
sure to provide the correct information, and do not add nor remove anything from the default template. If you think one of the fields is unnecessary for your post, leave it blank and the editor who reviews your post may remove it.

```yaml
---

merch_banner: merch_one
merch_sidebar: merch_one
---
```

More information about each field can be found below.

#### Title

The title is the headline for your post. Headlines matter, both to the reader and when it comes to search engine optimization (SEO). Below are some best practices for writing headlines:

#### Author

Write out the author's name here. If you want to credit multiple authors please use the following format:

`Anthony Davanzo and Kelly Hair` (see a [live example of multiple authors](/blog/2019/09/17/gitlab-hashicorp-terraform-vault-pt-1/))

Please include the `guest: true` field in the frontmatter as well.

#### Cover image

There are a few options you can choose from: pick an image from a [library of original images](#library-images), [choose a stock image](#stock-photography) to upload yourself, [request a custom cover image](#original-images) from Design, or [publish without a cover image](#no-image).

Follow the ["Guidelines for Use of Third-party IP in External Materials"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/ip-public-materials-guidelines).

##### Library images

We have some original illustrations for our blog categories and most popular topics which you are welcome to choose from. You can view these in [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/source/images/blogimages/library](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/tree/master/source/images/blogimages/library). In the `image_title:` field in the frontmatter, please enter your chosen image's file path using the format `/images/blogimages/library/engineering.png`.

##### Stock photography

Choose one from any public domain resource. [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is our preferred
resource for public domain images.

Please [add a reference](#image-attribution) to the cover image source, owner, and license at the end of the blog post, even if it doesn't require attribution.

Please [see the instructions on sizing, formatting, and storing images](#images-and-illustration).

###### Inclusive photos

We try to keep images on the blog neutral in terms of gender, ethnicity, etc. This generally means avoiding using stock images of people. It is also better to avoid using images of people (for example, GitLab team members at an event) for the cover photo because the blog post title and description overlay the image, which can look too busy.

##### Original images

If you would like an original design for your blog post image, please [open a design request](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#brand-and-design-issue-templates). 

If you prefer, you can [create an image](#preparing-images) yourself. If using Artificial Intelligence to create an image, follow the [legal guidance for use of "AI-generated images"](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/ip-public-materials-guidelines/#ai-generated-images).

##### Images for integration posts

If the blog post is about an integration, the DRI from Partner Marketing should [open a design request](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#brand-and-design-issue-templates) for a custom cover image as far in advance as possible.

##### No image

If you don't have an image in mind or can't think of anything to use, just remove the `image_title` field from the [frontmatter](#frontmatter). But, without at least a Twitter image it will be difficult for the social team to promote your post. Please **do** include a Twitter image in the frontmatter: `twitter_image: "/images/blogimages/file-name.png"` even if it's just a generic Tanuki. 

For more information on this, please see the [Social Marketing handbook](/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/admin/#adding-frontmatter-to-gitlab-owned-pages-for-proper-social-sharing) if you would like to use a specific image for the social media thumbnail.

#### Featured

Add `featured: yes` to the frontmatter of a post to create a featured post. The most recent featured post will be shown at the top of the blog in the featured section (even if more are tagged). To remove a post from being featured, remove the `featured: yes` line from the frontmatter.

#### Categories

Use only **one** of the following categories per post.
**Do not** change the capitalization, spelling, or anything else,
otherwise you'll create another category, which is something we don't want to do accidentally.

If you're not sure which category your post belongs in, just put a placeholder in your MR and leave a comment for your reviewer noting that.
- `DevOps` - general reference to DevOps
- `devops platform` - posts mentioning GitLab's DevOps Platform, or DevOps platforms more generically.
- `DevSecOps` - posts more generally about DevSecOps
- `engineering` – technical, actionable content. Anything covering how to do something, use something, or solve a problem should fall under this category
- `open source` – stories from or about our community, users, or the wider open source community
- `product` - posts more generally about our product 
- `careers` – posts about careers, salaries, education, and more
- `culture` – posts about remote work, working together, or GitLab culture
- `insights` – industry, data, newsjacking, developer survey, etc.
- `news` – company or product announcements (including policy changes, operational announcements, and breaking changes), news, or events
- `security` – security-related posts
- `releases` - release posts, security and patch releases. Posts in the `releases` category need to be in the `sites/uncategorized/source/releases/posts` directory, not `sites/uncategorized/source/blog/blog-posts`. Please see the [Release Post handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) for more.

#### Description

This field should provide a short summary of your blog post. It's best to think about your description in relation to the [title](#title) of your post. Don't repeat the title in the description; use it as an opportunity to provide more context or information about your post for the reader, and to work in the primary keywords.

The [`description`](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) meta tag is important
for SEO, and it appears underneath the title of your post on the post itself and on the [blog index page](/blog/). It is also part of Facebook Sharing and Twitter Cards. Descriptions should be limited to 150 characters, otherwise the text will be cut off on the index page.

#### Tags

These are included to help readers find similar posts if they are interested in a particular subject. Tags appear at the top of each blog post, and clicking on a tag takes you to [/blog/tags](/blog/tags.html) where you can view all tagged posts and browse by tag.

You can include as many tags as you like, separated by commas. Please only include tags from the following list, and note that they are case sensitive. 

- agile
- ARM
- AWS
- bug bounty
- careers
- CI
- CD
- cloud native
- code review
- collaboration
- community
- contributors
- customers
- demo
- design
- developer survey
- DevOps
- events
- features
- frontend
- Group Conversations
- git
- GitOps
- GKE
- google
- growth
- inside GitLab
- integrations
- kubernetes
- news
- open source
- partners
- patch releases
- performance
- product 
- production
- releases
- remote work
- research
- security
- security releases
- security research
- solutions architecture
- startups
- testing
- tutorial
- UI
- user stories
- UX
- webcast
- workflow
- zero trust

#### Call to action

The CTA entry is optional; if you don't need to add any CTA to the hero, just omit both entries, leaving the frontmatter without them. Do not include any UTM parameters in the link. Always wrap their values with quotes.

The final result is a red button over the cover image of the post.

#### Comments

Comments are present on all posts by default. In the rare case that you want to disable comments on a particular blog post, you can do so by adding a line to the frontmatter: `comments: false`

Please do this only with good reason, as comments are an important source of feedback and engagement on blog posts.

#### EE trial banner

To not display the EE trial banner on the blog post, set `ee_cta` to `false` in the frontmatter. It is set to true by default, so there's no need to add `ee_cta: true` to the frontmatter. Only set to false on the rare occasion you have a strong reason to not display the banner (usually in the case of posts that are for developers and our open source community).

#### Post type

We use these to make it faster to track the effectiveness of different types of blog posts. There are several post type categories we use to differentiate blog content:

1. **Content marketing:** Examples, education, reporting, storytelling, thought leadership, and use cases.
1. **Corporate:** Company news, announcements, and community updates (ex: issue bash, contributor profiles).
1. **Product:** Release posts, critical updates, and partnership announcements.
1. **dev-evangelism:** Blog posts authored or contributed to by members of the [Developer Evangelism](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/) team.
1. **Product Marketing:** Blog posts authored or contributed to by members of the [Product Marketing](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/core-product-marketing/) team.
1. **Technical Marketing:** Blog posts authored or contributed to by members of the [Technical Marketing](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/technical-marketing/) team.
1. **edu-program:** Blog posts authored or contributed by [Education Program Team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/education-program/)
1. **oss-program:** Blog posts authored or contributed by [Open Source Program Team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-programs/opensource-program/)

Use the `postType` frontmatter option to set the content definition.

### Media embeds

We limit media embeds to the following providers:
- **YouTube** for video
- **CodePen** for code samples
- **Google Docs** for collaborative text
- **Google Sheets** for sharing spreadsheets
- **Google Slides** for sharing slides

### Newsletter sign-up form

We can now embed a CTA for readers to sign up for our newsletter directly from the blog post page. There are two different designs. Use the following:

```
<%= partial "includes/blog/content-newsletter-cta", locals: { variant: "a" } %>
```

  Result:

  ![Newsletter sign-up CTA variant A](/images/handbook/marketing/newsletter-cta-a.png){: .shadow}

  OR

  ```
<%= partial "includes/blog/content-newsletter-cta", locals: { variant: "b" } %>
  ```

  Result:

  ![Newsletter sign-up CTA variant B](/images/handbook/marketing/newsletter-cta-b.png){: .shadow}

  Note: this only works for blog post files with the extension `.html.md.erb`.

### Click to tweet

Consider adding pull quotes as click-to-tweet boxes, to encourage and make it easier for readers to share key points from your blog post. This only works for blog post files with the extension `.html.md.erb`.

To add a click-to-tweet box, copy the below partial and enter the `text` and `author` fields. If the author doesn't have a Twitter account you can use `gitlab` instead.

  `<%= partial "includes/blog/tweet", locals: { text: '', author: '' } %>`

Example:

  ```
  <%= partial "includes/blog/tweet", locals: { text: 'The Operations experience then should really just be that I go to work in the morning and see an email summary of what has happened, without me having to do anything', author: 'MarkPundsack' } %>
  ```

Renders:

![Click to tweet](/images/handbook/marketing/click-to-tweet.png){: .shadow}

### Related posts

Ideally you should choose three blog posts related to your post, using the URL format shown. Your choices will be automatically displayed at the bottom of your blog post. Please choose posts no more than two years old and that are directly relevant to your main theme. If you do not specify related posts here, they will default to showing the three most recent posts from the same category.

### Merch banner and sidebar

These should be included by default on all blog posts. Use your discretion; if it doesn't seem appropriate to include merchandizing on a post you can leave out either the sidebar or both the sidebar and banner. Examples: If we're announcing a partnership or integration, if the blog post contains lots of images and a sidebar could distract from the content, or if the blog post is very technical in nature (a tutorial or post describing a security advisory, offensive security practices, etc.) and merchandizing undermines the authenticity or intent of the content or author.

There are two steps to include these: Designate what merch sidebar and banner to add in the front matter [example frontmatter above](/handbook/marketing/blog/#frontmatter), and add the merch sidebar inside your content:

#### Merch sidebar

To add a merch sidebar to your blog post, you need to designate it in the front matter. We are in the process of implementing Netlify CMS to publish blog posts. Currently merch sidebars will not display on your blog posts. [Read more here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/-/issues/1069).

#### Merch banner

Merch banners are automatically added to the end of blog posts if they are designated in the frontmatter. Adding the following will add the 2nd Merch Banner:

```
merch_banner: merch_two
merch_sidebar: merch_two
```

#### Current merch items

Merch items are defined in one data file and implemented across all blog posts during the build process. You can see all current merch items in [blog_merch.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/blog_merch.yml)

``` blog-merch.yml
merch_one:
  destination_url: "/resources/guide-to-the-cloud/"
  cta_text: "Learn more"
  banner_image_source: "/images/merchandising-content/mc-guide-to-app-security-ebook-vertical.png"
  banner_body_title: "Guide to the Cloud"
  banner_body_content: "Harness the power of the cloud with microservices, cloud-agnostic DevOps, and workflow portability."

#### Requesting new merchandise

If you have a new asset you'd like to promote with merchandise on the blog, please open an issue in the Corporate Marketing project using the [`blog-merch-request` issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/growth-marketing/brand-and-digital/brand-and-digital/-/issues/new?issuable_template=blog-merch-request). When you have filled in the required copy, please ping @luke to assign someone from the Design team to create the required images. When you have these, create a merge request to add the new merch to the www-gitlab-com repository and update the [current merch items](#current-merch-items) in this handbook. If you're not sure how, please ping @laurenbarker on your issue.

### Adding code blocks

Below are the two types of code blocks we commonly use on the blog. Find a number of other options in the [Markdown guide](/handbook/markdown-guide/#code-blocks).

#### In-line code

We use this for short words or phrases included in a paragraph. For inline code, surround the word or code with single backticks (`).

**Example:**

This is an ``` `in-line` ``` code block.

**Results in:**

This is an `in-line` code block.

#### Fenced code blocks

"Fenced" code blocks look like the block below. We use these for longer code snippets. To create a fenced code block, put triple backticks on one line directly above and one line directly below the code.

**Example:**

![how to create fenced code block](/images/handbook/marketing/fenced-code-example.png){: .shadow.small.left}

**Results in:**

```
this is my code block
   here's another line
end
```

#### Highlighted code

Syntax highlighting helps make code easier to read. In order to enable syntax highlighting please append the language type at the end of the code block. The name matters because every language is highlighted differently.

**Example (not highlighted):**

```
```code goes here```
```

```
document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(elem => {
    elem.addEventListener('click', e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        let block = document.querySelector(elem.getAttribute('href')),
            offset = elem.dataset.offset ? parseInt(elem.dataset.offset) : 0,
            bodyOffset = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().top;
        window.scrollTo({
            top: block.getBoundingClientRect().top - bodyOffset + offset,
            behavior: "smooth"
        });
    });
});
```

**Versus (highlighted javascript):**

```
```code goes here```javascript
```
(or other languages/syntaxes such as yaml, ruby, sql, etc)

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(elem => {
    elem.addEventListener('click', e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        let block = document.querySelector(elem.getAttribute('href')),
            offset = elem.dataset.offset ? parseInt(elem.dataset.offset) : 0,
            bodyOffset = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().top;
        window.scrollTo({
            top: block.getBoundingClientRect().top - bodyOffset + offset,
            behavior: "smooth"
        });
    });
});
```

### Images and illustration

Blog images are stored in the `source/images/blogimages/` directory. If your post contains many images, create a sub-directory for your post: `source/images/blogimages/name-of-post/`.

#### Preparing images

- If creating an original cover image, the dimensions should be 900px x 400px at least, but ideally 1800px x 800px for optimal quality on all displays.
- If using an existing image for the cover (e.g. stock photography), if it is in landscape format you may not need to crop it. Please check the blog post preview locally or in the review app to ensure the image appears as expected.
- All images should be less than 1MB. JPEGs tend to be smaller than PNGs so use JPEGs when possible. You can compress images using [TinyPNG.com](https://tinypng.com/) or any other image editor.
- To resize in Preview go to `Tools`, `Adjust size` and adjust the entry in the `Resolution` field. Preview will estimate what the resulting image size will be before you click `OK` to confirm.
- Keep all the images the same width.

#### Image attribution

The only images accepted for about.GitLab.com are public domain images, screenshots, and original images. Whenever you choose an image which is not a screenshot, add a link to the original image to the merge request description and as an HTML comment:

```html
<!-- image: image-url -->
```

Do the same for [cover images](#cover-image), adding a link to the original image to the end of the post:

```md
Cover image by [owner name and surname](link) on [Unsplash](link)
{: .note}
```

You can paste this from the box that appears on Unsplash when you have downloaded an image. 

For original images generated by artificial intelligence, link to the engine used. For example:

```md
Cover image generated by [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).
{: .note}
```

For images not from Unsplash:

```md
[Cover image](link-to-original-image) by [owner name and surname](link), licensed under [CC X](link-to-licence)
{: .note}
```

#### Inline images

To add an image inline, insert the following into your markdown file, where you want the image to appear:

```md
![Alt text for your image](/images/blogimages/your-image-filename.jpg){: .shadow}
```

The alt text for your images should describe the content and function of your image for visitors using a screen reader.

#### Sizing and aligning images

There are new classes for sizing and positioning blog post images. They should be added to blog post images similar to how the `shadow` class is added already:

``` md
![Your image alt text](/images/blogimages/your-image-filename.jpg){: .shadow.small.left.wrap-text}
```

The new classes are grouped into:

**Size**

- `.medium`: Display image 75 percent of page width
- `.small`: Display image 50 percent of page width

**Position**

- `.left`: aligned left (default)
- `.center`: centered
- `.right`: aligned right

**Effect**

`.wrap-text`: Only applies to images that are positioned left or right. Makes text wrap around the image.

These classes are only applied for screens 992px wide and wider.

If a Position class is used without an Effect class then there will simply be empty space where the image isn't. Similarly, using a Position class without a Size class will have little-to-no effect.

#### Image captions

Insert the following beneath an inline image to include a caption:

```
This is my image caption
{: .note.text-center}
```

This will look as below:

This is my image caption
{: .note.text-center}

#### Screenshots

For technical/tutorial posts, please illustrate your examples with [code blocks](#adding-code-blocks) or screenshots. Be consistent with your examples. E.g., if you are using a generic URL
to exemplify your steps `domain.com`, be consistent and keep it `domain.com`, throughout the post.

- Static images should be used to illustrate concepts, provide diagrams, elements of the UI or orient the reader.
- Images should not be used to render commands or configuration which would prevent someone being able to copy and paste.
- Animated GIFs can be used sparingly where you need to show a process or some event happening over the course of time or several actions, though they should not replace text descriptions or instructions.
- Use screenshots to identify and localize specific parts of the screen. There are great tools for doing so. For example, Nimbus Screenshot (browser extension), Mac screenshot, Snipping Tool for Windows, and Screenshot Tool for Ubuntu.

**Important security point:** Do not expose your personal details by using your real tokens or security credentials. Use placeholders such as `[project's CI token]` stub instead. Or blur them if displayed on screenshots.

#### Embedding videos

Please see the [Markdown Guide](/handbook/markdown-guide/#display-videos-from-youtube) for instructions for embedding videos from YouTube and other sources.

If appropriate, please add a video credit, for example:

```
Video directed and produced by [Aricka Flowers](/company/team/#arickaflowers)
{: .note}
```

#### Embedding tweets or Instagram posts

Please see the [Markdown guide for instructions for embedding posts from social media](/handbook/markdown-guide/#embed-tweets).

#### Creating GIFs

Animated GIFs are very useful to illustrate short dynamic processes, which might be easier to understand with this kind of resource.
There are a few ways to create animated GIFs, one of them is using [Giphy Capture], a light-weight app for Mac.

Avoid GIFs with a huge file size, they will be difficult to load for users with bad internet connection. In those cases, you can either cut the GIFs in smaller pieces, or record a video, or use a sequential image.

Read more on [Making Gifs in the Product Handbook](/handbook/product/making-gifs/).

#### Resizing Images

Image sizes can exceed megabytes and slow down the site rendering. Follow the proportions above and learn more about [resizing images](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#resizing-images).

## When you're ready to create your blog post

There are three ways to create a blog post MR:

1. Use [Netlify CMS](/handbook/marketing/netlifycms/)*
1. Add a new file to `sites/uncategorized/source/blog/blog-posts/` [in the UI](#creating-a-blog-post-mr-from-the-ui)
1. [Use the terminal](#creating-a-post-from-the-command-line) on your own computer

*We have recently implemented Netlify CMS for drafting and publishing blog posts. This is fairly new, and there are several videos to help you learn how to use this tool.

</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

#### Creating MRs for confidential issues

If your blog post issue is confidential, please don't create an MR using the button on your issue – instead follow the instructions below. This also applies if there isn't an issue for the post (only in rare cases of extremely sensitive information).

 1. [Create a new merge request from a new branch through the UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html#new-merge-request-from-a-new-branch-created-through-the-ui) **OR** [create your blog post MR starting from the command line](#creating-a-post-from-the-command-line).
 1. When you have created your MR, apply the blog post MR template and make sure the description includes `Closes [link to your confidential issue]` to create the connection between the issue and the MR, so that when the MR is merged the issue will close automatically.

**Note that your MR will not be confidential**. If information is under embargo it is best to prepare the blog post in a Google Doc or locally and create the MR ~1 hour ahead of publish time to keep the blog post private. This is to allow time for pipelines to pass before the post is live. Just give the branch and MR generic names to avoid drawing attention to them.

**For time-sensitive announcements** we recommend finding out from #production on Slack who the [Engineer On Call](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#roles-and-responsibilities) will be at the time you are hoping to publish, so you can give them a heads up about the plans and you know who to contact on the day if there are any production issues with GitLab.com.

Feel free to give a thumbs up to [this feature request for confidential MRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222404) and [this issue exploring implementing private staging in Netlify CMS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/-/issues/1149).

### Creating a blog post MR from the UI

You should have an issue for the blog post you are writing. Go to the issue and click `Create merge request`.

![Create merge request button](/images/handbook/marketing/create-mr-screengrab.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Now you have a merge request! Please edit the title to be "Draft: Blog Post - Title of blog post".

Make sure you select the blog post template for your MR, as this contains some important tasks for you to complete.

![MR template for blog post](/images/handbook/marketing/blog-mr-template.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

You can assign the MR to yourself while you are working on it.

#### Adding your blog post file to the MR

Click on the link to the right of `Request to merge` (this is the name of your branch).

![branch name](/images/handbook/marketing/branch-name-screengrab.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Now navigate to `sites/uncategorized/source/blog/blog-posts/` in the tree view, then click on the `+` dropdown menu and select `New file`.

![New file](/images/handbook/marketing/new-file.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Enter your filename using the format `yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-your-post.html.md.erb`. This will become the URL for the blog post so please keep that in mind and don't use something like `my-blog-post-draft`! 😄

![New file](/images/handbook/marketing/enter-filename.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Please do not include special characters, capital letters, or numbers (other than the date) in your filename as this can lead to issues with publishing and can break the link to your review app.
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-orange}

If you aren't sure when the post will be published, just choose an arbitrary date in the future – we will update it before publishing.

Now you can paste your post content into the window. If pasting from a Google Doc or another word processor, please make sure you convert it to plain text first. A quick way to do this is to paste everything into the URL bar of a browser, and paste it into your blog post file from there.

![Example blog post file](/images/handbook/marketing/example-blog-post-file.png){: .shadow.medium.center}
Note that there is no blank line at the top or lines in between your front matter items.
{: .note.text-center}

When ready, scroll down and enter a description of what you've just done in the `Commit message` box. Make sure the `Target branch` is correct (i.e. has the number and title of the issue for your blog post) then click `Commit changes`.

![commit message](/images/handbook/marketing/commit-message.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

You will then see your added file. To go back to your MR, it's easiest to go to your MRs in your dashboard (this is why it's important to assign the MR to yourself when you create it). You'll find all MRs assigned to you in the top right corner of your screen.

![MR dashboard](/images/handbook/marketing/mr-dashboard.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

In your MR, if you scroll down and go to the `Changes` tab, you should see the blog post file you added there.

![Changes tab](/images/handbook/marketing/changes-tab.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### Previewing your blog post

To see a preview of your post as it will look when it's live, you will need to wait for the pipeline to pass. You can check its progress from the `Pipelines` tab. When it passes, you can click on `View app` near the top of your MR and it will open a new tab with your preview. **Please check your review app before asking anyone else to review.**

![Link to review app](/images/handbook/marketing/review-app-link.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

If the link to the review app results in the error shown below, please check that the filename does not have any upper case letters in it, as that can cause the link to break.

![review app error](/images/handbook/marketing/review-app-error.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### If the review app is missing

If you don't see `View app` button, you may need to restart the review app.*

Click on the last pipeline icon and retry the `review` job. This will re-deploy the environment and enable the review app in the MR again.

![Restart Review App](/images/handbook/marketing/review-app-restart.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

*The website and blog posts are deployed as web application into CI/CD environments. For cost savings, idle deployments can be stopped automatically, causing halted review apps.
{: .note}

#### If your pipeline fails

The most common reasons for a failed build or pipeline when working on blog posts is a production issue with GitLab.com, or something entered incorrectly in the [frontmatter](#frontmatter).

Common errors are:

- Incomplete quotation marks: on lines such as the title, description, and image, you usually wrap the text in quotation marks. If you leave a quotation mark off, the build will fail. If your text includes single quotation marks or an apostrophe, make sure you enclose the text in double quotation marks to avoid confusion:
  - e.g. "There's something you need to know." or "Have you ever asked yourself, 'What am I doing here?'"
- A special character in the front matter keys (for example, `#`). Fix this by wrapping the text value into single quotes: `title: 'Everyone can contribute: Insights from #GitChallenge'`
- A dangling new line in the first line. The front matter header needs to begin and end with **3 dashes**: `---`.
- The GitLab/Twitter authors have the `@` character added. This is not needed, remove the `@` character.

</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

If the blog post pipeline fails due to a timeout error (something beyond your control), you can trigger a new pipeline without pushing a new commit: go to the `Pipelines` tab and click on `Run Pipeline`.

![Trigger new pipeline](/images/handbook/marketing/run-pipeline.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### Making changes to your blog post

If you need to make changes to your file, including editing the filename to update the date when you are ready to publish, you can edit it by going to the `Changes` tab, clicking on the three dots menu on the right of your blog post file, and selecting `Edit in single-file editor`, which will take you to the same interface as when you added your new file. Just make your changes, edit the commit message to say what you did and hit `Commit changes`.

![Edit button](/images/handbook/marketing/edit-file.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### When your blog post is ready for review

When you're ready, assign the MR to a fellow team member to review your post. When they have reviewed and you've addressed any comments they had and resolved any outstanding discussions, please assign your MR **and the corresponding issue** to the Editorial team member who reviewed your pitch to review.

You may find this video walkthrough helpful for creating your blog post MR from the UI:

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cxs5EMHNf6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

### Creating a post from the command line

You will need to be set up to edit the website locally in order to create your post this way. Please see [how to edit locally](/handbook/git-page-update/) for instructions. If you're already set up:

- Run `git checkout master`
- Run `git pull` to ensure your version of master is up to date with GitLab.com
- Run `git checkout -b new-branch-name` (substitute `new-branch-name` with whatever you want to call your branch)
- Now run

```sh
rake new_post
```

Hit **enter** or **return**, then you'll be prompted to enter the post title. Type in the title exactly as you want it, for example "Hello World – I'm a new post" and rake will take care of the filename for you. Then you just open the file, fill out the front matter and start writing, or paste your (plain text) draft in from your Google Doc.

### Adding a cover image to your blog post MR

Most blog posts require a new [cover image](#cover-image). You should upload your chosen image to the same branch as your blog post file, so that it is all included in the same MR. This means it will be published to the website simultaneously, and also allows you to preview your cover image in the review app. **If you're using [Netlify CMS](/handbook/marketing/netlifycms/) you can add your cover image there.**

#### Step 1: Upload image file

When you have selected an image to use, save it on your computer, ensuring you don't include any capital letters, spaces, or special characters in the filename.

Now go to your MR and click on the branch name after`Request to merge`.

![branch name](/images/handbook/marketing/branch-name-screengrab.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Navigate to `source/images/blogimages/` in the tree view, then click on the `+` dropdown menu and select `Upload file`

![Upload file](/images/handbook/marketing/upload-image-file.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Drag and drop or click to upload your image file, then enter a description of what you've just done in the `Commit message` box. Make sure the `Target branch` is correct (i.e. has the number and title of the issue for your blog post) then click `Upload file`.

To go back to your MR, it's easiest to go to your MRs in your dashboard (this is why it's important to assign the MR to yourself when you create it). You'll find all MRs assigned to you in the top right corner of your screen.

![MR dashboard](/images/handbook/marketing/mr-dashboard.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

In your MR, if you scroll down and go to the `Changes` tab, you should see the blog post file you added there.

![Changes tab](/images/handbook/marketing/changes-tab.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### Step 2: Add file path to blog post file

Make a note of the name of your image.

![Image file name](/images/handbook/marketing/image-file-path.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Scroll down to your blog post file and click on the pencil icon (Edit file button).

![Edit button](/images/handbook/marketing/edit-file.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

This will take you to the same interface as when you added your new file.
In the frontmatter, look for this field:

```
image_title: '/images/blogimages/post-cover-image.jpg'
```

Change the image filename to the name of the image you just uploaded. Ensure that you keep the whole path the same (so, starting with `/images/blogimages/`). Now edit the commit message to say what you did and hit `Commit changes`.

Go back to your MR. If everything has been done correctly, when the pipeline passes your review app should show the cover image as expected.

![Link to review app](/images/handbook/marketing/review-app-link.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

#### What if my cover image isn't showing?

This is usually because the image filename and what you entered in the frontmatter do not correspond. Look out for typos in either the filename or in the frontmatter.

Make sure that the image path is correct (i.e. it begins with `/images/blogimages/` – no missing slash at the front, no `source` before the first slash).

It often helps to look at the file of [another recent blog post that is already live](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/tree/master/sites/uncategorized/source/blog/blog-posts) and compare it to your file to see if there are any discrepancies.  

## When your blog post has been published

Once your blog post is live, the Editorial team member who merged it will share it in #content-updates on Slack. From there, a team member from Social Marketing will schedule it for our social channels.

You should promote your content too! Please see the Social Marketing handbook for [Team Member Social Media Advocacy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/integrated-marketing/digital-strategy/social-marketing/team-member-social-advocacy/).

You can also view the below [How to Make Your Content Work Harder for You](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RPSkAWtXtWfbuoHD9D1iSdt5o1d7a4MA5QPGjGeFFXM/edit?usp=sharing) training from Corporate Communications:
