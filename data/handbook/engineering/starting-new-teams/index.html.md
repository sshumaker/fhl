## Starting new teams

Our product offering is growing rapidly. Occasionally we start new teams. Backend teams should map to our [product categories](/handbook/product/categories/). Backend teams also map 1:1 to [product managers](/handbook/product/).

A dedicated team needs certain skills and a minimum size to be successful. But that doesn't block us from taking on new work. This is how we iterate our team size and structure as a feature set grows:

1. **Existing Team:** The existing PM schedules issues for most appropriate existing engineering team
    - If there is a second PM for this new feature, they work through the first PM to preserve the 1:1 interface
1. **Shared Manager Team:** Dedicated engineer(s) are identified on existing teams and given a specialty
    - The manager must do double-duty
    - Their title can reflect both specialties of their engineers _e.g._ Engineering Manager, Distribution & Package
    - Even if temporary, managing two teams is a valuable career opportunity for a manager looking to develop director-level skills
    - Each specialty can have its own process, for example: Capitalized team label, Planning meetings, Standups
1. **New Dedicated Team:**
    - Engineering Manager
    - Senior/Staff Engineer
    - Two approved fulltime vacancies
    - A dedicated PM

## Team Construction

Generally engineering teams at GitLab are functional, they are made up of Frontend, Backend, or Fullstack individual contributors and an engineering manager with the same functional background. This is intended to provide scalable hiring capabilities, technical credibility, and career development support for all team members. When hiring at scale, these functionally focussed teams are better able to hire and onboard people as well as supply them with ongoing, clear support. An alternative team construction that could be considered for some circumstances is the **Fullstack Team**.

Circumstances would include cases where a team:
* Operates with a single manager and has yet to grow to full capacity.
* Has been structured this way for efficiency of delivery.

The goal should still be to move to a functional construction.

### Fullstack Teams

A Fullstack Team has Frontend, Backend, and/or Fullstack engineers lead by a Fullstack Engineering Manager. An example of this might be where a product category group has a Frontend and a Backend team, if either of those teams is significantly smaller than the other and, the engineering manager has experience working in both Frontend and Backend, a fullstack team could be considered as a measure of efficiency. It's not the intention of this type of team to remove productive team members for the sake of efficiency, in the scenario above, if there were two managers, care would need to be taken to find the other manager a role within GitLab team.

Examples of Fullstack Teams:

- [Package Team](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/package/)
- [Acquisition Team](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/acquisition/)
- [Activation Team](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/)
- [Geo Team](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/systems/geo/)

## Fast Boot Events

New teams may benefit from holding a [Fast Boot](/handbook/engineering/fast-boot/) event to help the jump start the team.
During a Fast Boot, the entire team gets together in a physical location to bond and
work alongside each other.
