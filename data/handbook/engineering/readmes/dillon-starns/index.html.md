## Dillon Starns' README

**Dillon Starns, Manager, Support Engineering (AMER-E)** 

This is a very rough draft and first iteration of my README file. I just started at Gitlab 2021-11-30 (I''m writing this 2021-12-14) and am still finding my way around things and am knee-deep in onboarding, but I think the personal README file is a great idea and I''d like to start fleshing this out. So, in the spirit of iteration, here''s the first tiny bit of many things I will add here later, I''m sure.


## About me

I love technology and music both, genuinely. I have many hobbies but those are my two main ones. I spend a lot of my free time learning more about tech or tinkering with Home Automation IoT DIY projects, I also spend a fair bit listening to or making music.

## How you can help me

1. Be upfront and clear about what you need/want from me. I'll never judge you or take anything personally, but I will take what you say at face value as a matter of trust. If I'm not providing what you need or missing something, let me know. Don't be shy!
2. 

## My working style

I tend to work best in extremely focused blocks that I power through (usually around six to eight hours) without breaking, but after that I need to stop and recharge for a few hours before being much use again. I'm actively trying to change this as I know it's not the healthiest/best method but right now, small breaks in focus de-rail me for hours. I'm working on balancing this.

## What I assume about others

That they are well-intentioned and honest.

## What I want to earn

- Your Trust
- Your honest belief/understanding that we are on the same level and same page.

## Communicating with me

In order of best/most preferred to least:
1. Slack
2. GitLab
3. Zoom
4. Email
5. Phone
   
## Strengths/Weaknesses

1. I spend too much time focusing on details and overthinking smaller items
   1. Recent examples around the time I'm typing this for example:
      1. I just added to do list items in my personal Trello board to "Decide on Consistent Personal File Naming Format"
      2. I spent five ten minutes fiddling with the markdown/formatting of my personal notes as I was adding some more information to them this morning.
