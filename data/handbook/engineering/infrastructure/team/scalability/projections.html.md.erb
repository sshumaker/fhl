## Projections

This team focuses on forecasting & projection systems that enable development engineering to understand
system growth (planned and unplanned) for their areas of responsibility. Error Budgets and Stage Group Dashboards
are examples of successful projects that have provided development teams information about how their code runs on GitLab.com.

We use metrics to gather data to inform our decisions. We contribute to the observability of the system by maintaining
metrics that concern saturation and improving observability tools that we can use to help us understand how the system
responds to load.

## Team Members

The following people are members of the Scalability:Projections team:

<%= direct_team(manager_slug: 'rachel-nienaber')%>

## Team Responsibilities

We are responsible for Capacity Planning and Error Budgets.

### Capacity Planning

We maintain and improve the Capacity Planning process that is described [in the Infrastructure Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/). This is a controlled activity covered by SOC 2. Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/sec-compliance/observation-management/-/issues/604) for further details

The goal of this process is to predict and prevent saturation incidents on GitLab.com.

Issues are kept in the [capacity planning issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/capacity-planning/-/issues). Where
an issue is needed to improve metrics to support this process, we raise an issue in the [Scalability group tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues) with
the label of `Saturation Metrics`.

The responsibility for reviewing Tamland reports rotates between team members and includes the Engineering Manager. 

The rotation is arranged alphabetically by first name and lasts for a minimum of three weeks. There is flexibility in the schedule to allow for OOO and on-call responsibilities. 

The purpose of having a longer rotation cycle is to provide exposure to the wide variety of capacity warnings that occur and to enable each person to gain context on every component that we monitor. 

#### Triage Duties

The triage duties are:
1. Review all capacity planning issues that are past their due date, or in the Open column (which means they do not have a `capacity-planning::` workflow label). The [saturation labels](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/#saturation-labels) can help in choosing which issues to review first, if there are many with the same due date.
1. For each item, check if the warning still applies and follow up with the DRI or other engineers for an updated status.
1. Set appropriate due dates for the next review.
1. Raise any significant concerns through the Engineering Allocation meeting (currently on Tuesdays in UTC afternoon) by adding them to the [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zk3qgbn8iDyJRq0i5C5LPBgEopY6o1tpYEKfdNfA9Bg/edit#). If something is really pressing, please verbalize or find someone in the team to do it.
1. Check that Tamland is running and generating output and bring this to the team's attention if it is not running. Check the [scheduled pipelines on ops](https://ops.gitlab.net/gitlab-com/gl-infra/tamland/-/pipelines?page=1&scope=all&source=schedule) for this. There should be a daily job populating the cache, and a weekly job for tamland without failures.

When your rotation is finished, you need to provide handover notes in the #infra_capacity-planning channel for the incoming person. 

### Error Budgets

We maintain the Error Budgets process that is described [in the Engineering Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/error-budgets/).

Issues are kept in the [Scalability group tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues) with
the label of `Category::Error Budgets`.

We maintain the metrics used to generate the Error Budgets and we ensure that the reports are published on time.

We advocate for improving the SLOs for Stage Groups and we provide support to help them achieve this. Providing the Stage Groups
with data about how their feature categories operate on GitLab.com enables them to make good choices about how to efficiently
improve the reliability, availability and performance of their feature categories.

## Indicators

The Scalability group is an owner of several performance indicators that roll up to the Infrastructure department indicators:

1. [Service Maturity model][service maturity model] which covers GitLab.com's production services.
1. The forecasting [project named Tamland][tamland] which generates and displays [utilization and saturation reports][tamland reports]

These are combined to enable us to better prioritize team projects.

An overly simplified example of how these indicators might be used, in no particular order:

* Service Maturity - provides detail on how trustworthy the data we received from observability stack in relation to the service; the lower the level the more focus we need to improve the service observability
* Tamland reports - Provides a forecast for a specific service

Between these different signals, we have a relatively (im)precise view into the past, present and future to help us prioritise scaling needs for GitLab.com.
