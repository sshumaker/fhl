## Mission

The General Team supports the Reliability Team's [overall vision](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#vision) by supporting services for GitLab.com that do not fit the mission of the other [Reliability Teams](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams). See the [dedicated General Team Page](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/general.html) for more details.

## Vision

The General Team exists to ensure that all services at GitLab are properly supported by either providing that support directly or routing requests for new work to the appropriate [Reliability team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/reliability/#reliability-teams) while also being the primary operators and maintainers of the GitLab.com application.  In the short-term (12-24 months), the goal is shrink the overall pool of what we call "General" by assigning ownership of services to Standing Squads so that full attention can be paid to the processes, frameworks, architecture and automation required to properly support the GitLab.com application in the long term (24+ months).

## Ownership

### Services
The General Team is assigned issues based on the services they own.  This currently includes:

| Service | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Sidekiq | GitLab.com Application|
| API | GitLab.com Application |
| Snowplow | GitLab.com Application |
| PackageCloud | GitLab.com Application |
| Pages | GitLab.com Application |
| Git | GitLab.com Application |
| GitLab Rails | GitLab.com Application |
| Security-response | The General Team is responsible for coordinating the work for security issues that involve other services that are owned by the General Team.    |
| Infrastructure | This is a broad category to include any work <br> where a service label cannot be assigned or <br> created. |
| KAS | This service has no permanent team assigned |

### Overlap
It is not always easy or possible to definitively determine the primary services associated with an issue, incident, or other piece of work.  When there is a lack of clarity, General Team members should collaborate with other Reliability Teams to determine the best path forward.  If necessary reach out to any Reliability Engineering Manager for assistance.
