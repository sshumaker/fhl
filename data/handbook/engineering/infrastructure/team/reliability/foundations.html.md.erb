## Mission

The mission of the Reliability:Foundations team at GitLab is to Build, Run and Own the entire lifecycle of the core infrastructure for GitLab.com.

The team is focused on owning the reliability, scalability, and security of the existing core infrastructure. We seek to reduce the effort required to provide our core infrastructure services, and to enable other teams to self-serve core infrastructure that allows them to more efficiently/effectively run their services for GitLab.com.

In order to enable Infrastructure, Development & Product teams to build their services for GitLab.com and fulfill their respective missions, we work to make the consumption of our services as simple as possible.

We seek to build our services on top of GitLab features, and use cloud vendor managed products to reduce complexity, improve efficiency and deliver new capabilities more quickly, where they are the right choice.

While the team does not explicitly have any product responsibilities, we endeavor to contribute the lessons we learn from running at-scale production systems back to the product teams, and advocate for GitLab to contain features that would allow us to DogFood.

## Vision

The Foundations Team supports the rest of Infrastructure and Development by providing the resources that other teams build upon. We do so by working collaboratively, iteratively, and striking the right balance between delivering results quickly yet safely.

## Ownership

### Services

The Services that the Foundations team is responsible for fall into two general categories: Core and Edge.

#### Core

| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| K8s | K8S workloads deployments, Cluster addons | Autodeploy remains with Delivery, and anything Delivery related is co-owned with Delivery |
| Config | Terraform, Chef, Image Builds | The core TF repos are owned by Foundations, while specific modules may be maintained by the teams that use them |
| Service discovery | Consul | |
| Secrets Management | Vault | |
| Ops | Ops.gitlab.net, Ops Runners | |

#### Edge

| Service | Description | Co-Ownership? |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- |
| CDN | Cloudflare, Fastly | |

### Overlap

Given the nature of this team's scope, several services the Foundation team works with are either co-owned by other teams or directly impact their work, as noted above.
