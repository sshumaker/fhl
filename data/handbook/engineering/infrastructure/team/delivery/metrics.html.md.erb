# Metrics

[Delivery team] uses Mean Time To Production (MTTP) as an indicator of our speed capabilities
to deploy application changes into production. 

* [Performance Indicator]
* **Target: 12 hours.**

<%= partial('mttp_chart', locals: { mttp: mttp_performance_indicator }) %>

MTTP measures the elapsed time (in hours) from merging a change in gitlab-org/gitlab project master
branch, to deploying that change to GitLab.com.

## MTTP breakdown

MTTP is conformed by:

* Time to inclusion: The merge request is merged and waiting to be included in an auto-deploy branch.
* Time to package: The package to be deployed is being built.
* Time to staging: Time it takes for the package to be deployed to staging and tested.
* Time to canary: Time it takes for the package to be deployed to canary and tested.
* Time to production: Time it takes for the package to be deployed to production.

To measure the MTTP subcomponents, the following metrics are used:

* [Deployment SLO](#deployment-slo)

These allows to decide whether we need to focus on speed or safety would have the
biggest impact on further reducing MTTP.

### Deployment SLO

* **Target: 8 hours.**
* [Dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/delivery-deployment_slo/delivery-deployment-slo?orgId=1&refresh=5m)

Deployment SLO measures the deployment frequency and duration by tracking
the percentage of deployment pipelines that complete within the target duration. 
Deployment duration is measured as the elapsed time between a starting on staging canary (`gstg-cny`)
through the completion of the deployment on Production (`gprd`).
