## What is Gitaly?

The Gitaly team is responsible for building and maintaining systems to ensure
that the Git data storage tier of GitLab instances, and _GitLab.com in particular_,
is reliable, secure and fast. For more information about Gitaly, see our [Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitaly/) page and [roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7608).

Gitaly team consists of two subgroups, [Gitaly:Cluster team](#cluster-team) and [Gitaly:Git team](#git-team), together referred to as **Gitaly**.

### Functional boundary

While GitLab is the primary consumer of the Gitaly project, Gitaly is a standalone product which can be used external to GitLab. As such, we strive to achieve a functional boundary around Gitaly. The goal of this is to ensure that the Gitaly project creates an interface to manage Git data, but does not make business decisions around how to manage the data.

For example, Gitaly can provide a robust and efficient set of APIs to move Git repositories between storage solutions, but it would be up to the calling application to decide when such moves should occur.

Processes fully independent of business inputs (such as repository maintenance) should be fully contained within Gitaly as they provide substantial value to anyone using the Gitaly project.

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

## How to contact the team

### Urgent issues and outages

Gitaly team members do not carry pagers, but we live around the world and there's a good chance that someone is available during their working hours. There is no coverage for weekends; instead, we strive to empower incident responders to mitigate any circumstance.

These issues relate to ongoing production outages or similar. They interrupt our process used to [schedule work] and get attention as soon as possible.
Please only interrupt us sparingly, in these cases:
- [Severity 1 or 2](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#availability) issues, where you believe that Gitaly team has _immediately actionable_ work to do
- Ongoing incidents where no mitigation exists that would tide us over until the next business day.

**Getting attention on an urgent, interrupting issue**

- If there's no issue filed yet, file one in the [Gitaly issue tracker] (remember that Security incidents and those containing customer details should be Confidential).
- Tag Engineering Manager and Product manager (listed above) as well as `@gl-gitaly` (the [whole team](https://gitlab.com/groups/gl-gitaly/-/group_members)) on the issue.
- Post on [#g_gitaly] on Slack, mention the issue, and tag EM and PM again.
- The issue will be attended to by the first available staff member during their working hours, who will assign it to themselves, and explicitly hand it off by reassigning to the next person should this be necessary.

### Customer issues

Please file an issue [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Support%20Request). Post it on [#g_gitaly] for more immediate visibility.

### Normal priority requests

To get Gitaly team work on something, it's best to create an issue on the [Gitaly issue tracker]
and add the `group::gitaly` and `workflow::problem validation` labels,
along with any other appropriate labels.  Then, feel free to tag the relevant
Product Manager and/or Engineering Manager as listed above.

For information requests and other quick one-offs, feel free to use [#g_gitaly] on Slack to get attention on the issue.

### Issues with `Infradev` labels

These are typically [Corrective Actions or other followup items](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev) that have strict
SLO tracking. They will be scheduled through either of the above paths, by EM
and/or PM polling these dashboards:


## Cluster team

**Mission**: Provide a durable, performant, and reliable Git storage layer for GitLab.

[Responsibilities](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/#cluster) |
[In the product hierarchy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#gitalycluster-group)

<%= department_team(base_department: 'Gitaly Cluster Team') %>

## Git team

**Mission**: Develop Git in accordance with the goals of the community and GitLab, and integrate it into our products.

[Responsibilities](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/#git) |
[In the product hierarchy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#gitalygit-group)

<%= department_team(base_department: 'Gitaly Git Team') %>

## Working with product

### Agile workflow in Gitaly

We generally follow the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#workflow-summary) to schedule and track our work.

Work is executed in small chunks (2-3 days of work), each tracked as an issue. This allows for natural "checkpoints" for safe context switching.
Triaging and scheduling is separate from executing the current work. All incoming work is tracked and we are intentional about picking up new work.

Incoming work of all kind (both projects and ad-hoc interrupts) passes by EM and PM for triage. There may be some engineering consultation here about feasibility,
fit with the product's strategy roadmap etc. Some will get scheduled, some goes to the backlog. If the effort is not deemed necessary or not believed
to align with the roadmap, we will close the issue with commentary as to why it is not being pursued for future reference.

We aim to scope milestones such that we have a task list that is ambitious, but not overwhelming. We deliberatly leave some capacity
for incoming incidents.
We want to avoid the feeling of a never ending mountain of work to promote a healthy work / life balance.
It is also important to stress, that milestones are recommendations only and we work on the best effort basis.

For issues with a strict SLO, we follow the process defined [below](#handling-issues-with-strict-slo)

We use the following workflow labels on the issues:

1. `workflow::problem validation` - A good spot to put features that we may / may not want to pursue. This is where product can do some user interviews, cost analysis, market fit, etc to decide if it's an opportunity we wish to pursue.
1. `workflow::solution validation` - Use this label for features / issues where Engineering needs to investigate / propose a solution going forward, or break it down into smaller issues.
1. `workflow::planning breakdown` - Issues ready to be scheduled in the next few milestones (unblocked or soon unblocked, with a known solution). Leaders of long-running (pre-approved) projects use this to communicate with PM.
1. `workflow::ready for development` - Work that is scheduled for a milestone (either the current one, or one in the future).
1. `workflow::in dev` - Actively being worked by the Engineering team
1. `workflow::in review` - Work that is in review
1. `workflow::verification` - code is in production and pending verification by the DRI engineer
1. `workflow::complete` - changes are verified, issue can be closed

Issues scheduled for the milestone (with `workflow::ready for development` and a specific release milestone assigned)
can be further prioritized by moving them up or down on the dashboard.

Issues that we definitely want to prioritize for a release receive a `Deliverable` label and are moved to the top of the list.
These `Deliverable` issues help show our commitment to GitLab and our customers around working on these issues.

Engineers ready to pick up more work do not necessarily need to assign the topmost item, but rather make an informed choice
with affinity (area of expertise, relative urgency, interest etc).

Everyone can file new issues as more work is discovered, and feed them into this process.

Note that P1/S1 work should be the only one to preempt this default flow. Do involve PM and EM if urgent work needs to be prioritized.

A weekly call is held between the product manager and engineering managers (of both Cluster and Git teams).
Everyone is welcome to join and these calls are used to discuss any roadblocks,
concerns, status updates, deliverables, or other thoughts that impact the
group.

### From OKRs to projects and tasks

OKR planning is done before every quarter, for the next 3 milestones. At the time, we must have a good idea of the work that needs to be done.
The process is as follows:

1. EM+PM (with input from engineers and stakeholders): decide the scope we'll be working on.

1. EM+PM+Engineers: File issues for the work, not for KRs -- the work may slip or get rescheduled, and there's already tracking for the KRs themselves in Ally.
1. EM: Tie the issues to KRs in Ally.io. This is mostly for reporting/communication of what we want to work on. Where possible, align with the larger organization's objectives.

1. PM: Once the scope of the quarter is clear, take the list of issues and assign one of the three milestones, along with `workflow::planning breakdown` (for large issues in need of breakdown) or `workflow::ready for development`.

1. Engineers: pick up `workflow::planning breakdown` items and file smaller issues if needed, adding them to the same 3 milestones as reasonable. Raise exceptions as needed.

### Handling issues with strict SLO

Issues with `Infradev` label are typically [Corrective Actions or other followup items](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev) that have strict
SLO tracking. They will be scheduled through either of the above paths, by EM
and/or PM polling these dashboards:

[Infradev issue details](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/899982/InfraDev?widget=12327718&udv=0)
[Past due Infradev issues](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/899982/InfraDev?widget=13349849&udv=0)

1. EM+PM: Poll the dashboards at least weekly. Triage and schedule these issues so that SLOs can be met. If needed, move the issue to the Gitaly tracker, or file a proxy issue there so that it shows up on work boards, and mark it as blocking. Drag issues to the top of the workflowready for development column.

1. EM+PM: If the issue is blocked or depends on ongoing work, add a Milestone that fits the SLO and the pending work (so that we don't forget it). Ensure that blocking work gets scheduled before.

1. Engineers: please prioritize picking up this work, and post frequent (at most weekly, even if no changes) updates in the original issue. Mark any blocking issues as such.

## Gitaly consumers

To have a constant communication flow about planned changes, updates and maybe
breaking changes we have the [#g_gitaly] Slack channel. In the
channel we will provide updates for all teams using the service but also ask
for assistance to provide feedback and insights about planned changes or improvements.

To support this pro-active communication additionally there is also an individual
counterpart on the consumer side to help with research in the codebases and
coordination with all the teams consuming Gitaly. The DRI on Consumer side is Igor Drozdov.

The Gitaly consumers are:

* [GitLab Rails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
* [GitLab Shell](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell)
* [GitLab Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/development/workhorse/index.md)
* [GitLab Elasticsearch Indexer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer)

## Retrospectives

At the beginning of each release, the Gitaly EM will create a retrospective issue
to collect discussion items during the release. The first weekly Gitaly meeting
after the 18th that issue will be used to discuss what was brought up.
