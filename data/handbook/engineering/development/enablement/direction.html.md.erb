   * Distribution: 4
   * Frontend: 0
* Reviewers:
   * Backend: 4
   * Database: 1
   * Frontend: 1
   * Distribution: 1
* Subject Domains:
   * Deploy and configure GitLab via both VM (Omnibus) and Cloud Native (Helm Chart, OpenShift) methods
   * Disaster recovery, backup/restore, replication
   * Advanced Search based on Elasticsearch
   * PostgreSQL Database
   * Performance tuning and memory optimization

## Where We Want To Be In One Year

### Product
#### Goals 
Refer to the [product direction one year plan](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/enablement/#one-year-plan).

#### Gaps
Below are identified key areas of improvements for the remainder of FY22.
1. Cloud Native deployment needs a leap.
   1. Helm Chart maturity is Viable, with Complete scheduled for FY22 Q1.
   1. OpenShift support development began in FY21-Q3 with an MVP planned in FY22-Q1.
1. Disaster Recovery maturity is Viable but needs to be Complete to win large deals.
1. Backup and restore functionality is only minimally supported.
1. Global search results relevancy, ranking, UX, and performance can be improved.
1. Performance, scalability, and memory footprint.
   1. API endpoint performance bottlenecks and memory footprints.
   1. Performance product analytics of self-managed.
   1. Continued database query performance improvements through impact analysis and targeted improvements.
   1. Reduction in database size and growth rate.
   1. Database index size growth.
   1. Run GitLab on Raspberry Pi smoothly.

### Great Team
#### Goals
1. A Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging environment.
1. All team members are motivated and engaged.
1. Effective iteration with a goal of narrow MR rate = 7~8.
1. High Efficiency with a goal of Review to Merge Time meeting the goal of Development department.
1. Strong servant leadership team.

#### Gaps
1. There are only 2 women engineers on the team and no woman leadership members.
1. Team can benefit from additional maintainers, especially domain expert maintainers.
1. MR rate is below Development average, which means there may be still room to improve iteration.
