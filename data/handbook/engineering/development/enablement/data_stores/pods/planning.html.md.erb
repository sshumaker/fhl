### Introduction
This page displays our current thinking about what the Pods Group is currently working on and what is in the furture for the Group. 
The information is likely to change regularly as we learn and progress through our work.

The overall goal is to display near term detailed goals and aspirational longer term goals, planning out to a rolling four quaters providing a roadmap.

### Why are we doing it?
We believe it is essential to be as transparent as possible about the work we are doing and what we can achieve. This process provides a single source of truth giving clarty to Pods Group team members and the wider GitLab community about our direction and when pieces of work have been planned in.
We will also be able to report and measure  our progress and show where we have adjusted our goals and why.


### The Process
To start this we will need to create FY24-Q2, FY24-Q3 and FY24-Q4 planning issues with high-level one-line summary points in the description.

Then as we enter the process:
* In each quarter we will create a new planning issue keeping four quarters of planning in progress
* In the second month of the quarter - add detail to the next quarters' planning issue.
* We will Report on progress at the monthly Pods AMA and describe any adjustments made to the plan for the current quarter.
* In the AMA in the third month of the quarter we will report on what we plan to achieve the in the next quarter using that quarters' planning issue.
* Each week at the Pods sync call we will report on our progress against the plan and refine it as needed.

### Current Planning Issues
Below is a list of planning issues we currently have open. There may not be a lot of information in them when we open them. We will review and iterate on them over time.
