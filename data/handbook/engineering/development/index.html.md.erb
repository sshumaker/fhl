## Vision

Scale and develop our diverse, global team to drive results that support our product and customer growth, while maintaining [our values](/handbook/values/) and [unique way of working](/company/culture/all-remote/guide/).

## Mission

GitLab's unique way of working asynchronously, handbook first, using the product we develop, and with clear focus on our values enables very high productivity. In delivering on growth, we maintain our values and ways of working while developing team members and increasing the diversity of our team. We focus on constantly improving usability and reliability of our product to reach maximum customer satisfaction. Community contributions and customer interactions rely on efficient and effective communication. We are a data-driven, customer experience first, open core organization delivering one secure, reliable, world leading DevOps platform.

## FY23 Direction

FY23 has similar ambitions as FY22. During FY22, the Development department focused on reliability/security, team, SUS, and product. We added EA (Engineering Allocation) and the FCL (Feature Change Lock) processes to support the improvements in reliability and security. We reduced the number of past due issues in both categories by 77% and 72% respectively, and continue focusing on reducing this further. We have grown the team by 22% during FY22 while retaining 90% of team members, and have set ourselves up for further growth in FY23. We have begun investing further in SUS improvements after seeing a 7% improvement via various activities, including component migrations. We have improved the product using standard product management and development processes. Users want to see these improvements as well as improvements in reliability and security.

As we have set ourselves at the end of FY22, FY23 will focus on growth, efficiency, usability, product, and diversity.   

### Growth

This year we have goals to increase the size of the Development Department by over 20% to increase our team's capacity to deliver in new and existing product areas. To achieve this, we are focused on collaborating closely with our recruiting team, building a diverse pipeline of candidates, and successfully onboarding new team members into our way of working. Each sub-department will set goals for their teams to hire based on planned headcount increases. We expect to meet our hiring goals while not going over, which is essential to 1) meeting the growing development needs of GitLab's [business strategy](/company/strategy/) and 2) hiring at a predictable rate in-line with our financial plans. We commit to investing dedicated time and budget in learning and development, specifically to development topics through internal courses, such as O'Reilly Learn, etc.

### Efficiency

GitLab's Development group ships thousands of product merge requests per month. Continuing to scale our development process to an ever larger number of contributors requires efficiency, collaboration, and iteration. In FY23, we want to keep our MR Rate stable as we continue to onboard new team members, increasing our overall output and demonstrating the scalability of our approach to development. We will focus on training our new hires on iteration and process improvements, saving team members time. We will also review the best metrics to focus on and are considering moving back to an overall MR Rate measure (from an authorship one). Doing so will help us measure the efficiency of our responsiveness to our peers for the company and the community. 

### Usability

User experience is a continued focus area for FY23.  Millions of customers use GitLab so UX improvements can have a huge collective impact across all of these individuals.  We support this effort both in the product development as well as in our architecture. This includes continued conversion of [Pajamas components](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/pajamas-design-system/) in order to continue to improve performance experienced by users.   Also efforts like burning down significant ([Sev 1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=SUS%3A%3AImpacting&label_name%5B%5D=severity%3A%3A1&first_page_size=100) and [Sev 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=SUS%3A%3AImpacting&label_name%5B%5D=severity%3A%3A2&first_page_size=100)) usability issues, addressing [Usability Benchmark insights](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Usability%20benchmark&first_page_size=100), are part of our short and long term goals.

Development team members should also constantly suggest and investigate how to improve the overall user experience of the product. These can range from enhancing performance (actual and perceived), suggesting new technologies, solving user experience issues efficiently, etc.

### Product with a customer focus

Lastly, we will continue our strong partnership with Product to make GitLab the best, most complete DevSecOps platform on the planet. While we continue adding features to the product we must also work to identify technical debt and bring it to the prioritization discussion. We expect that Engineering managers are already addressing technical debt that is group specific with their Product Manager. 

This coordination and prioritization requires a lot of work and effort to provide the right data and make the right decisions. We will focus on a variety of factors, but top of mind will be our parent department's direction to be [customer focused](/handbook/engineering/#expand-customer-focus-through-depth-breadth-and-stability).

### Diversity

We will follow our parent department [Engineering](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/#diversity) lead.  

## Organizational responsibilities

The development team is responsible for developing products in the following categories:

- [Dev](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/)
- [Sec](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/)
- [Ops](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/)
- [Data Science](/handbook/engineering/development/data-science/)

## Development-Specific People Processes

### Promotion Process

Aligned with the [company-wide promotion cadence](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#promotions-process--timeline), Development utilizes a quarterly process to collect, validate, approve, review all promotion proposals prior to them being added via the company-wide [process](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#bamboohr-promotion-approval-process). The goal of this quarterly promotion projection and review is to:

- Promote the right people at the right time
- Maintain a high bar for promotions
- Ensure predictability and intentionality with promotions
- Ensure alignment with overall company [promotion rate](/handbook/people-group/people-success-performance-indicators/#promotion-rate)
- Add another layer of review to reduce bias in the promotion process

Development adheres to the company-wide quarterly timeline outlined [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#promotions-process--timeline) as our SSOT.

**The Development Department has an additional formal step built in to our promotion process beyond what the company is currently adhering to through our peer review process**. Ahead of the commencement of the [Calibration](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration) stage of our process, all promotion documents should be peer reviewed by a Senior Manager or Director. The due date to complete the peer review is _before_ the scheduled Calibration session. 

FY'23 Calibration sessions:
1. FY23-Q1: January 13, 2022
2. FY23-Q2: April 7, 2022
3. FY23-Q3: June 30, 2022
4. FY23-Q4: October 5, 2022

Calibration session attendees are the following team members: Senior Managers, Directors, Sr. Directors, VP, and Development's aligned People Business Partner. Leaders are welcome to conduct Calibration sessions prior to the scheduled sessions above with their sub-departments as well (though this is not a requirement). 

In addition to the [company-wide calibration preparation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration), for the Development department we also ask that leaders come prepared to discuss:

1. Status of maintainership
2. Most recent talent assessment 

We use a [peer review process](/handbook/engineering/development/promotion-process/) to collaborate on proposed promotions.

### Talent Assessment Process

Company-wide guidelines on the Talent Assessment can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#timeline). The company timeline for the process remains SSOT, the guidelines are below are meant to:

- Provide additional check points and due dates built into the company-wide timeline for Development specifically (as one of the larger departments at GitLab)
- Guidance on department-specific calibration section structure (attendees, leveling, etc.) 
- Outline our strategy in terms of who we will be calibrating in the Development Department

#### Who Are We Calibrating?

We will be reviewing outliers for Performance/Growth Potential and anyone identified as Key Talent for calibration this cycle. Formal calibration will take place at the Senior Manager, Director, and VP levels. The thought process around who qualifies as an "outlier" for Performance and Growth Potential [is outlined here](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#who-do-i-calibrate). 

Calibration and assessment are two different steps in the process. The assessment phase is the process of assessing each team member to determine their Performance and Growth Potential, whereas the calibration phase (occurring after initial assessments are made) is when management calibrates across the stage/org/level/etc. to discuss and align on assessments. Every team member should be assessed and have supporting points to justify those assessments - but to make calibration sessions more focused and scalable, we focus on [outliers](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#who-do-i-calibrate).

For Development specifically, we will calibrate:

1. Anyone in [Box 1](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performancegrowth-matrix) aligned with [company-wide guidelines](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#who-do-i-calibrate). 
1. Anyone in Box 9 who has been with GitLab longer than 3 months.
1. Anyone assessed as `Exceeding` for Performance
1. Anyone hired in the last 3 months assessed as `Performing` or `Exceeding` for Performance aligned with [eligibility guidance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#eligibility) or `Growing` or `Exceeding` for Growth Potential
1. Anyone identified as Key Talent

It's important to note that while these will be our focus areas for calibration sessions, managers should feel free to raise any team member's assessment up for discussions if they have any questions or concerns. Calibrating outliers is not a limitation, but rather a structural adjustment to ensure this process is scalable and focused. 

_Note: If individual teams want to calibrate every individual, they have the ability to do this/organize/structure separately, but the due dates remain in place across the department to ensure we have enough time to review and calibrate at the various levels in the company._

#### How To Assess Acting/Interim

For team members who have assumed an [Acting or an Interim role](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#interim-and-acting-roles), we will assess team members aligned with their *permanent positions* (I.E. not the Acting or Interim position). 

As the Talent Assessment impacts compensation, and Acting/Interim periods are not permanent, in the instance that a team member does not end up moving into the Acting/Interim role permanently, we would not want to have their compensation impacted by a temporary position.

#### Pre-Calibration Prep Work

In addition to the [calibration session pre work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#calibration-session-guidelines) on the Talent Assessment page, we ask that you complete the following:

1. Directors should conduct sub-department level calibration sessions ahead of the department-wide Development calibration sessions. In addition to calibrating on initial assessments, Directors are responsible for ensuring their respective teams assessments fall within the [expected distribution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#expected-distribution-performancegrowth-potential-company-wide) ahead of the department-wide calibration session for efficiency.

1. Performance and Growth Potential notes need to be added to the [session agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrlZSfdNXpSZ09uvDM71KxH42RWBJxa6U1QTCTw05iI/edit#) for each team member at least 3 business days before the synchronous calibration session. 

1. Managers should include 2-3 supporting points for each team member for the assessment under each section in the [agenda doc notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrlZSfdNXpSZ09uvDM71KxH42RWBJxa6U1QTCTw05iI/edit#) to help support the “why” behind the assessment. _Note: The overviews in the agenda document for calibration are meant to provide enough of an overview so peers have an understanding of the "why", while simultaneously not overwhelming with information and decreasing efficiency of the session. Please limit to 2-3 supporting points per team member._

1. Key Talent assessment need to be completed and added to the session agenda doc at least 3 business days before the live calibration session. 

  - If an individual is indicated as key talent, an explanation should be added to indicate how this individual qualifies as key talent against our [key talent definition](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent). Reminder that the bar for key talent is set high, and that key talent makes up roughly ~10% of the entire population. In Development, we will be calibrating Key Talent from the Senior Manager level and above [aligned with guidelines](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#process-to-determine-key-talent), meaning that while *everyone in the organization is eligible to be identified as Key Talent*, Senior Managers+ will be will be calibrating and making these final decisions. The rationale behind this decision is that is important to have a holistic view of all team members when determining who meets the key talent criteria, which is why we require a certain scope when assessing key talent in the organization.

While calibrations and ultimate determinations will take place at Senior Manager+ level, inital recommendations begin in Workday and sit with team member's direct managers aligned with the [process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#process-to-determine-key-talent)

1. Every session attendee should review the Performance/Growth Potential assessments and Key Talent overviews for outliers asynchronously ahead of the session to be prepared for live discussion/calibration.

### How we hire contractors


In [this handbook page](./processes/hiring-contractors.html) we document the process that the development department follows, including planning budget, candidate sourcing, interview process, contracting and onboarding.

## How We Work

### Onboarding

Welcome to GitLab! We are excited for you to join us.
Here are some curated resources to get you started:

- [Joining as an Engineer](/handbook/developer-onboarding/)
- [Joining as an Engineering Manager](/handbook/engineering/development/onboarding/manager/)

### Cross-Functional Metrics

    <p>You must set a <code>PERISCOPE_EMBED_API_KEY</code> environment variable to render this chart.</p>
<% end %>

<%= partial "includes/_cross-functional-prioritization.erb" %>

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

#### Working across Stages

Issues that impact code in another team's product stage should be approached collaboratively with the relevant Product, UX, and Engineering managers prior to work commencing, and reviewed by the engineers responsible for that stage.

We do this to ensure that the team responsible for that area of the code base is aware of the impact of any changes being made and can influence architecture, maintainability, and approach in a way that meets their stage's roadmap.

#### Architectural Collaboration

At times when cross-functional, or cross-departmental architectural collaboration is needed, the [GitLab Architecture Evolution Workflow](/handbook/engineering/architecture/) should be followed.

#### Decisions requiring approvals

At GitLab we value [freedom and responsibility over rigidity](/handbook/values/#freedom-and-responsibility-over-rigidity). However, there are some technical decisions that will require approval before moving forward. Those scenarios are outlined in our [required approvals](/handbook/engineering/development/required-approvals.html) section.

### Development Headcount planning

Development's headcount planning follows the Engineering [headcount planning](/handbook/engineering/#headcount-planning) and [long term profitability targets](/handbook/engineering/#long-term-profitability-targets). Development headcount is a percentage of overall engineering headcount. For FY20, the headcount size is 271 or ~58% of overall engineering headcount.

We follow normal span of control both for our managers and directors of [4 to 10](/company/team/structure/#management-group). Our sub-departments and teams match as closely as we can to the [Product Hierarchy](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) to best map 1:1 to [Product Managers](/handbook/product/).

### Development Staff Meeting

While we try to work as much as possible async, the Development department leadership does meet synchronously on a cadence of weekly. This meeting coordinates initiatives, communicates relevant information, discusses more difficult decisions, and provides feedback on how we are progressing as an organization. As part of this meeting, we discuss our culture of reliability monthly. This was part of the agenda spawned from an initiative we took up in August of 2021. We want to make sure we keep the organization healthy when thinking about reliability in every part of our work.

### Developing and Tracking OKRs

In general, OKRs flow top-down and align to the company and upper level organization goals.

#### Managers and Directors

For managers and directors, please refer to a good [walk-through example of OKR format](/company/okrs/#example-developments-approach-to-okrs) for developing team OKRs. Consider stubbing out OKRs early in the last month of the current quarter, and get the OKRs in shape (e.g. fleshing out details and making them [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)) no later than the end of the current quarter.

It is recommended to assess progress **weekly**.

1. Append the percentage score to the subject of Objective epics and Key Result issues.
1. Set the [Health status](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#maintaining-the-status-of-okrs) of epics and issues.
1. In the case where weekly assessment is impractical, an assessment shall be made by the end of each month.

#### Staff Engineers, Distinguished Engineers, and Fellows

Below are tips for developing individual's OKRs:

1. Align OKRs to team goals. However, it's unnecessary to derive from all organizational OKRs. Simply decide what makes sense to your personal situation.
1. Follow the same timeline of managers and directors, i.e. stubbing out early and bring OKRs in shape by the end of the current quarter.
1. Refer to the same [walk-through example of OKR format](/company/okrs/#example-developments-approach-to-okrs).
1. Make [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) OKRs - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
1. Follow the same progress assessment instructions above.

#### Examples

1. [Engineering](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/7253)
1. [Development](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/7148)

## Engineering Allocations and Tracking

[Engineering Allocation](/handbook/engineering/#engineering-allocation) require us to track goals with more diligence and thought.  We need confidence that we’re making correct decisions and executing well to these initiatives. As such, you will see us reviewing these more closely than other initiatives.  We will meet on a cadence to review these initiatives and request additional reporting to support the process.  Possible requests for additional data:

We will hold Engineering Allocation Checkpoints on a cadence.  The recommended cadence is weekly.

### Roadmaps for Engineering Allocations

We track Engineering Allocation [roadmaps](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?state=opened&sort=end_date_asc&label_name%5B%5D=Engineering+Allocation).  To use this effectively, roadmaps must have correct dates for their epic and weights assigned to issues.  If a team does not normally use weights, then assign each issue a weight of 1 (all issues are equal).  

#### Team allocation measurement

Each team needs to demonstrate how their allocation is being used.  This is done to verify we are not over/under investing for a given initiative.  This can be done via assignment (people assigned to work) and/or issues assigned.  We will track [issues and MRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/11340) and see as a percentage how that compares to the overall teams work.

### Ownership of Shared Services and Components

The GitLab application is built on top of many shared services and components, such as PostgreSQL database, Redis, Sidekiq, Prometheus and so on. These services are tightly woven into each feature's rails code base. Very often, there is need to identify the DRI when demand arises, be it feature request, incident escalation, technical debt, or bug fixes. Below is a guide to help people quickly locate the best parties who may assist on the subject matter.

#### Ownership Models

There are a few available models to choose from so that the flexibility is maximized to streamline what works best for a specific shared service and component.

1. Centralized with Specific Team
    1. A single group owns the backlog of a specific shared service including new feature requests, bug fixes, and technical debt. There may or may not be a counterpart Product Manager.
    1. The single group is a specific team, meaning there is an engineering manager and all domain owner individuals reside in this team. The DRI is the engineering manager.
    1. This single group is expected to collaborate closely and regularly in grooming and planning backlog.
    1. This model may require consensus from the Product Management counterpart.
    1. This model may fit a subject domain that experiences active development.
1. Centralized with Virtual Team
    1. A single group owns the backlog of a specific shared service including new feature requests, bug fixes, and technical debt. There may or may not be a counterpart Product Manager.
    1. The single group is a virtual team, meaning it consists of engineers from various engineering teams, for example maintainers or subject matter experts. Typically there isn't an engineering manager for this virtual team. The DRI is an appointed person in the group who may not necessarily be an engineering manager.
    1. This single group is expected to collaborate closely and regularly in grooming and planning backlog.
    1. This model may fit a subject domain that's in maintenance mode.
1. Collectives
    1. Collectives consist of individuals from existing teams who voluntarily rally around a shared interest or responsibility, but unlike Working Groups may exist in perpetuity. The shared interest could be a specific technology or system. Collective members feel a collective responsibility to weakly own, improve upon or otherwise steer the subject they govern.
    1. This is a weaker form of the Virtual Team but introduces more structure than a fully decentralized model. It can be appropriate when some form of ownership is desirable where the subject has cross-cutting impact and wide reach and cannot clearly be allocated to any specific team.
    1. Collectives do not have product or engineering managers, they are fully self-governed.
    1. Members of the Collective sync regularly and keep each other informed about the shared interest. Problem areas are identified and formalized in the Collective, but are not logged into a Collective backlog. Instead a DRI is assigned who should put the task forward to the team with the greatest need for the problem to be resolved. This is to ensure that work is distributed fairly and that there are no two backlogs that compete with each other for priorities.
    1. Collectives work best when they consist of a diverse set of individuals from different areas of product and engineering. They double as knowledge sharing hubs where information is exchanged from across teams in the Collective first, and then carried back by the individuals to their specific teams.
1. Decentralized
    1. The team who implements specific functions or utilizes certain features of the shared services is responsible for their changes from local development environment to production deployment to continued maintenance post-deployment. There is not a development-wide single DRI who owns a portion or the entirety of a shared service.
    1. A specialty team may exist for specific subject domains, however their role is to enable scalability, availability, and performance by building a solid foundation and great tools for testing and troubleshooting for other engineering teams, while they are not responsible for gating every single change in the subject domain.

## Learning Resources

For a list of resources and information on our GitLab Learn channel for Development, consult [this page](/handbook/engineering/development/training/).

## Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure and Quality Collaboration

In late June 2019, we moved from a monthly release cadence to a more continuous
delivery model. This has led to us changing from issues being
concentrated during the deployment to a more constant flow. With the adoption
of continuous delivery, there is an organizational mismatch in cadence between
changes that are regularly introduced in the environment and the monthly
development cadence.

To reduce this, infrastructure and quality will engage development via
[SaaS Infrastructure Weekly](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1fLQQBKt0mShmTk_mJ-BmBM6OFjal63-AH7yKSbMg6_s/edit) and [Performance refinement](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#performance-refinement) which
represent critical issues to be addressed in development from infrastructure
and quality.

Refinement will happen on a weekly basis and involve a member of infrastructure,
quality, product management, and development.

### Global Prioritization

Execution of a Global prioritization can take many forms.  This is worked with both Product and Engineering Leadership engaged.  Either party can activate a proposal in this area.  The options available and when to use them are the following:

* [Rapid action](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#rapid-action) - use when reassignment isn't necessary, the epic can have several issues assigned to multiple teams
* [Borrow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#borrow) - use when a temporary assignment to a team is required to help resolve an issue/epic
* [Realignment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#realignment-of-team-members-impacting-multiple-teams) - use when a permanent assignment to a team is required to resolve ongoing challenges

### Email alias and roll-up

1. Available email alias (a.k.a. Google group):
Managers, Directors, VP's teams: each alias includes everyone in the respective organization.
1. Naming convention:
team@gitlab.com, examples below -
    - Managers: configure-be@gitlab.com includes all the engineers reporting to the Configure backend engineering manager.
    - Directors: ops-section@gitlab.com includes all the engineers and managers reporting to the director of engineering, Ops.
    - VP of Development: development@gitlab.com includes all engineers, managers, and directors reporting to the VP of Development.
1. Roll up:
Teams roll up by the org chart hierarchy -
    - Engineering managers' aliases are included in respective Sub-department aliases
    - Sub-department aliases are included in Development alias

### Working with Support

When Development collaborates with Support it provides invaluable insight into how customers are using the product and the challenges they run into. A few tips to make the process efficient:

 - Get [access to Zendesk](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/internal-support/#requesting-a-zendesk-light-agent-account) so you view the question and communication from customers.
 - Always write answers in a way that they can be "cut-and-pasted" and sent to a customer. 
 - Reference documentation in your responses and make updates to GitLab documentation when needed. 
 - Refer to existing issues and epics to reiterate our transparency value and to invite participation from the customer. 
- If you are unclear about the support-development collaboration process or workflow then please refer to the handbook page [how to use gitlab.com to request help from the GitLab development team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/how-to-get-help.html#how-to-use-gitlabcom-to-formally-request-help-from-the-gitlab-development-team)

### Incident Management

Team members in [some job families](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/incident-manager-onboarding/#introduction) contribute to incident management directly through an on-call schedule for Incident Managers.
Team members should [complete onboarding](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/incident-manager-onboarding/#how-does-someone-onboard-into-the-incident-manager-rotation) so they can be added to the schedule when needed.
These [frequently asked questions](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/incident-manager-onboarding/#questions-about-becoming-an-incident-manager) cover exemptions and changing shifts.

### Development Escalation Process

- [General information](./processes/Infra-Dev-Escalation/)
- [Process outline](./processes/Infra-Dev-Escalation/process.html)

### Reducing the impact of far-reaching work

Because our teams are working in separate groups within a single application, there is a high potential for our changes to impact other groups or the application as a whole.  We have to be cautious not to inadvertently impact overall system quality but also availability, reliability, performance, and security.

An example would be a change to user authentication or login, which might impact seemingly unrelated services, such as project management or viewing an issue.

Far-reaching work is work that has wide-ranging, diffuse implications, and includes changes to areas which will:
1. be utilized by a high percentage of users
1. impact entire services
1. touch multiple areas of the application
1. potentially have legal, security, or compliance consequences
1. potentially impact revenue

If your group, product area, feature, or merge request fits within one of the descriptions above, you must seek to understand your impact and how to reduce it. When releasing far-reaching work, use a [rollout plan](/handbook/engineering/development/processes/rollout-plans). You might additionally need to consider creating a one-off process for those types of changes, such as:
- [Creating a rollout plan procedure](/handbook/engineering/development/processes/rollout-plans)
   - Consider how to reduce the risk in your rollout plan
   - Document how to monitor the rollout while in progress
   - Describe the metrics you will use to determine the success of the rollout
   - Account for different states of data during rollout, such as cached data or data that was in a previously valid state
- Requiring feature flag usage ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests/88298))
- Changing a recommended process to a required process for this change, such as a domain expert review
- Requesting manual testing of the work before approval

##### Identified areas

Some areas have already been identified that meet the definition above, and may consider altered approaches in their work:

| Area             | Reason                      | Special workflows (if any) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------  |
| Database migrations, tooling, complex queries, metrics | impact to entire application<br/><br/>The database is a critical component where any severe degradation or outage leads to an S1 incident. | [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database_review.html#general-process) |
| Sidekiq changes (adding or removing workers, renaming queues, changing arguments, changing profile of work required)  | impact to multiple services<br/><br/>Sidekiq shards run groups of workers based on their profile of work, eg memory-bound. If a worker fails poorly, it has the potential to halt all work on that shard. | [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/sidekiq_style_guide.html#sidekiq-compatibility-across-updates) |
| Redis changes    | impact to multiple services<br/><br/>Redis instances are responsible for sets of data that are not grouped by feature category. If one set of data is misconfigured, that Redis instance may fail.  |                            |
| Package product areas            | high percentage of traffic share |       |
| Gitaly product areas             | high percentage of traffic share |       |
| [Create: Source Code product areas](/handbook/product/categories/features/#createsource-code-group) | high percentage of traffic share. Special attention should be paid to Protected Branches, CODEOWNERS, MR Approvals, Git LFS, Workhorse and the git over SSH / gitlab-sshd interfaces. Please contact the EM (@sean_carroll) or PM (@tlinz) if you are unsure. |
| Pipeline Execution product areas | high percentage of traffic share  | [Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/verify/) |
| Authentication and Authorization product areas    | touch multiple areas of the application    | [Documentation](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/manage/authentication-and-authorization#code-review) |
| Compliance product areas | potentially have legal, security, or compliance consequences | [Code Review Documentation](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/#code-review) |
| Workspace product areas    | touch multiple areas of the application    | [Documentation](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/manage/workspace#how-we-work) |
| [Specific fulfillment product areas](/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/#revenue-impacting-changes) | potentially impact revenue | |
| Runtime language updates | impacts to multiple services | [Ruby Upgrade Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ruby_upgrade.html#ruby-upgrade-guidelines) |
| Application framework updates | impacts to multiple services | [Rails Upgrade Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/rails_update.html) |

## ClickHouse Datastore usage

[ClickHouse usage by Monitor:Observability group](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/monitor/observability/#clickhouse-datastore)

## Customer Account Escalation coordination

If development is the DRI or actively participating in a [Customer Account Escalation](/handbook/customer-success/csm/escalations/), consider the following:

* Be careful to not make commitments to customers without first talking to product management and development leaders to confirm the impact that commitment may have on other commitments.
* The customer will want to know when they can see the benefits of a change. They may not be familiar with GitLab practices for tracking and predicting due dates and milestones. Also, they may not be familiar with our workflows and associated labels nor the predictability of code review timelines, different timelines on releases to GitLab.com compared with releases for self-hosted customers and our use of feature flags.
```
* Customers often don't rely on asynchronous communication at the level that GitLab does. Educate the customer on our practices and adapt to find a combined asynchronous and synchronous communication method and cadence that works for everyone.
* Encourage customers to collaborate with us in epics, issues, and merge requests of interest. Keep in mind that they may not have access to ones that are confidential and/or may not be comfortable or able to collaborate with us in this public forum.
* Consider utilizing Google documents to collaborate with the customer as a backup for collaboration via epics, issues, and merge requests.
* Consider utilizing a shared Slack channel to collaborate, adding the customers to our slack via "one Slack channel access requests".  [Example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/16192)
* In meetings, tell customers why we like to record them and ask if they are OK with doing so. Consider using [Chorus](/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/go-to-market/chorus/) for scheduling the recordings to address legal requirements for recording meetings with customers.
* In meetings, tell customers why we take notes before, during, and after the meeting, as it may not be natural for them to collaborate in this way.
* Make sure the appropriate priority label is applied to all issues being tracked by the customer.
* In the agenda for recurring meetings, track the items tracked by the customer in priority order at the top and review the status, next steps, customer DRI, and GitLab DRI for each.  Discuss in the meeting periodically.
Remind GitLab team members in Slack to update the status of items they are the DRI for before recurring meetings.
* Post a link to the meeting notes and recording in a Slack channel for the customer escalation, so those who did not attend know that the notes and recording are available for review.
* When there is an action item for someone in a meeting (whether they are present or not), tag them in an issue or MR (or in Slack) so they will see it.
