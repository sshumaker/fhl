## Vision

For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at [the product
vision](/direction/verify/). This team is responsible for delivering on the following directions: 

- [Continuous Integration](/direction/verify/continuous_integration/)
- [Continuous Integration Scaling](/direction/verify/continuous_integration_scaling/)
- [Merge Trains](/direction/verify/merge_trains/)

## Mission

The Verify:Pipeline Execution Group is focused on supporting the functionality with respect to
Continuous Integration [use case](/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/usecase-gtm/ci/). A key focus for the PE group is delivering features that achieve the outcome we track in our performance indicator.

This team maps to [Verify](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) devops stage.

## Performance Indicator

## Dashboards 

<%= partial "handbook/engineering/metrics/partials/_cross_functional_dashboard.erb", locals: { filter_value: "Pipeline Execution" } %>

#### Cross-functional prioritisation

The team uses the [`#g_pipeline_execution_quad`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C03KK284L23) Slack channel to discuss cross-functional prioritisation in addition to any other topics that require the quad to collaborate on. Additionally, the quad also reviews the [dashboard](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-execution/#merged-merge-request-types) which shows the % of MRs that are [bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4439443?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=type%3A%3Abug) vs [maintenance](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4439961?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=type%3A%3Amaintenance) vs [features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4440070?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=type%3A%3Afeature) to ensure the team's efforts are properly aligned to the prioritisation.

## How We Work

The [Pipeline Execution Workflow board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1372896?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution) is the source of truth for current and upcoming work.

### Planning

Our planning timeline follows the [GitLab Product Development timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline). 

* By the **4th** of each month:
  * The [`~needs weight` board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4178322?not%5Bmilestone_title%5D=Started&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name%5B%5D=needs%20weight) should be updated by the PM for all issues being considered for the next milestone that need weight and apply the `workflow::planning breakdown` label.
  * Based on capacity, engineers will assign themselves to `~needs weight` issues to apply weight.
  * The PM will assign or update `Verify::P*` labels for the refined issues to reflect prioritization based on the Theme and Goals of the milestone and any Cross Functional Prioritization.
  * The EM will move any `technical debt` issues they are considering for the next milestone into `workflow::planning breakdown`.
* By the **7th** of each month:
  * The designated DRI for milestone refining will review the state of issues in `workflow::planning breakdown` to ensure that all issues for the upcoming milestone are being weighted and refined by team members. 
  * For any issues where team members have not already started the refinement process, the designated DRI will comment on the issue asking a specific team member or team members to start the process. 
* By the **11th** of each month: 
  * The designated DRI for milestone planning will follow-up with engineers for any issues not yet in `workflow::ready for development`.
* By the **13th** of each month:
  * Engineers will refine the assigned issues and move them to `workflow::ready for development`.
  * Engineers will assign themselves to issues they plan to work on in the upcoming milestone.
* By the **14th** of each month:
  * The EM will assign developers to any unassigned issues in the milestone.
* By the **16th** of each month:
  * Engineers should consider any issues from the previous milestone that may carry forward when deciding their commitments, then add labels to their assigned issues as follows:
    * `~Deliverable` indicates they are committed to completing the issue in the milestone.
    * `~Stretch` indicates they are likely to at least start the issue and may complete it.
  * Engineers will unassign themselves from any issues they are not committing to (those not labelled `~Deliverable` or `~Stretch`).
  * Engineers will thumbs up :thumbsup: or thumbs down :thumbsdown: their commitment in the planning issue for the milestone. Thumbs Up indicates that they are committing as indicated by the labels to their assigned issues. Thumbs Down indicates that there is further discussion needed before a commitment can be made. In this case the engineer should start that discussion in the planning issue. 
* By the **19th** of each month:
  * The EM will work with the PM and engineers to decide what should happen to any unassigned issues. They might be:
    * Reassigned with agreement from the engineer.
    * Placed in the `%Backlog`
    * Moved to a future milestone.
    * Remain in the current milestone as `~Stretch` goals.
  * The EM and PM will remove any remaining issues in `workflow::planning breakdown` that do not have a due date requiring them to be completed in that milestone. They can either be moved into a future milestone or the %Backlog depending on team priorities. 

**Note:** The EM and PM may need to modify the team commitments and schedule work for the upcoming milestone as we focus on [Customer Results](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#results) over what we plan.

#### How Engineering Refines Issues

*side note: we prefer [using Refining over Grooming](/handbook/communication/#top-misused-terms)*

Engineers are expected to allocate approximately 4 hours each milestone to refine and weight issues assigned to them. The purpose of refining an issue is to ensure the problem statement is clear enough to provide a rough effort sizing estimate; the intention is not to provide **solution validation** during refinement.

Engineering uses the [following handbook guidance for determining weights](#weighting-issues). If any issue needs any additional `~frontend ~backend ~Quality ~UX ~documentation` reviews, they are assigned to the respective individual(s). 

##### Checklist for Refining Issues

1. Does the issue have a problem statement in the description?
1. Does the issue have the expected behaviour described well enough for anyone to understand?
1. Does the issue explicitly define who the stakeholders are (e.g. BE, FE, PM, UX and/or Tech Writer)?
1. Does the issue have a proposal in the description? *If so:*
    1. Does the proposal address the problem statement?
    1. Are there any unintended side effects of the implementation?
1. Does the issue have proper labeling matching the job to be done? (e.g. bug, feature, performance)

Any one on the team can contribute to answering the questions in this checklist, but the final decisions are up to the PM and EMs.

##### Steps for Refining and Weighting Issues

Engineers will:
1. Go through the checklist above for refining issues assigned to them
1. Split a backend issue out from the main issue if backend work needs to be completed before frontend work can begin
1. Add a [weight based on the definitions](#weighting-issues)
1. Update the `~workflow::` label to the appropriate status, e.g. 
   * ~"workflow::design" if further design refinement is needed, and let the designer know
   * ~"workflow::ready for development" when refinement is completed and a weight has been applied, signaling that it's ready for implementation and the issue can now be prioritized
   * ~"workflow::planning breakdown" if more investigation and research is needed, the status does not move, and the PM and EMs should be pinged
1. Unassign themselves from the issue when they are done refining and weighting the issue

#### Weighting Issues

The team makes use of the [`~needs weight` board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4178322?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=needs%20weight) that shows issues that need to be weighted for the next milestone. The criteria are denoted by having a `~needs weight` label and an appropriate milestone applied to it (i.e. `16.0`). During the first week of the month (i.e May 1-7), team members review the [`~needs weight` board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4178322?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=needs%20weight) and assign issues to themselves. The priority order will be determined from top to bottom utilizing the `Verify::P1`, `Verify::P2` and `Verify::P3` labels along with using `~priority::x` labels and other issues needing weight after that, keeping [global prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization) in mind. Issues that aren't able to be weighted in one milestone will be evaluated in future milestones. If there is an issue with a higher urgency for weighting, a team member might be directly assigned to the issue for a prioritized review.

We add a `Weight` to issues as a way to estimate the effort needed to complete an issue. We factor in complexity and any additional coordination needed to work on an issue.  We weight issues based on complexity, following the fibonacci sequence:

| Weight | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1: Trivial | The problem is very well understood, no extra investigation is required, the exact solution is already known and just needs to be implemented, no surprises are expected, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are documentation updates, simple regressions, and other bugs that have already been investigated and discussed and can be fixed with a few lines of code, or technical debt that we know exactly how to address, but just haven't found time for yet. |
| 2: Small | The problem is well understood and a solution is outlined, but a little bit of extra investigation will probably still be required to realize the solution. Few surprises are expected, if any, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.<br><br>Examples are simple features, like a new API endpoint to expose existing data or functionality, or regular bugs or performance issues where some investigation has already taken place. |
| 3: Medium | Features that are well understood and relatively straightforward. A solution will be outlined, and some edge cases will be considered, but additional investigation may be required to confirm the approach. Some surprises are expected, and coordination with other team members may be necessary.<br><br>Bugs that are relatively well understood, but additional investigation may be required.  The expectation is that once the problem is verified and major edge cases have been identified, a solution should be relatively straightforward.<br><br>Examples are regular features, potentially with backend or frontend dependencies or performance issues. |
| 5: Large | Features that are well understood, but has more ambiguity and complexity. A solution will be outlined, and major edge cases will be considered, but additional investigation will likely be required to validate the approach. Surprises with specific edge cases are to be expected, and feedback from multiple engineers and/or teams may be required.<br><br>Bugs are complex and may be understood, and may not have an indepth solution defined during issue refinement. Additional investigation is likely necessary, and once the problem is identified, multiple iterations of a solution may be considered.<br><br>Examples are large features with backend and frontend dependencies, or performance issues that have a solution outlined but requires more indepth solution validation.|

The maximum weighted value for an issue is a `5`, and may exceed one milestone to complete given additional dependencies and/or complexity. Consider whether an issue weighted with a `5` can be broken down into smaller iterations.

If an issue requires a feature flag rollout plan, consider increasing the weight by `1` or `2`, according to the effort involved in rolling out the feature flag and monitoring the new behavior.

### Release Plans

To encourage more transparency and collaboration amongst the team and additionally align on the [Release Posts](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) we publish at the end of each milestone, we will be creating a separate issue to highlight a **Feature flag roll out plan** for each feature being released starting in 13.2, based on the [issue template for feature flag roll outs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Feature%20Flag%20Roll%20Out.md). The engineer who implements the feature will be responsible for creating this separate issue to highlight the details of when and how the feature flag will be toggled, and subsequently link this issue to their feature issue.  The product manager will tag this issue as a blocker to their release post, so that everyone is aligned on the release plan of the feature.

#### Prioritization of issues

The team makes use of `Verify::P*` labels to indicate priority order of issues in addition to a stack rank in many areas. As part of milestone planning and review we may decide to change or remove the labels to reflect new priority for issues. Currently these labels are applied as follows.

| Priority Label | Reason for applying |
| ---- | ---- |
| `Verify::P1` | Our current focus is on reliability and stability of the GitLab.com platform. As such we use this label for any issues that have a category in the top 3 [Prioritization Framework](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization) table. |
| `Verify::P2` | After ensuring we are meeting our SLOs we are focused on delivering customer value and moving maturity of our categories forward. Issues with a `type::feature` and `direction` may be have this label applied. Not all `customer` issues will have this label in a milestone. |
| `Verify::P3` | Bugs or maintenance work that are not a `Verify::P1`, such as lower priority product initiatives, or research issues for upcoming large initiatives, etc. may be included in this category. |

### Workflow

We use the [Pipeline Execution Workflow issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1372896?milestone_title=%23started) to track what we work on in the current milestone.

Development moves through workflow states in the following order:

 1. `workflow::design` (if applicable)
 1. `workflow::planning breakdown` 
 1. `workflow::ready for development`
 1. `workflow::in dev`
 1. `workflow::blocked` (as necessary)
 1. `workflow::in review`
 1. `workflow::verification`
 1. `workflow::awaiting security release` (if applicable)
 1. `workflow::production`
 1. `workflow::feature-flagged` (if applicable)
 1. `workflow::complete` `Closed`

`workflow::planning breakdown` is driven by Product, but is a collaborative effort between Product, UX and Engineering. The steps for **planning breakdown** typically consists of:
 - Product defining or clarifying the problem statement. Product and UX will collaborate on `problem validation` as needed.
 - UX providing designs as needed.
 - UX reviewing issues that have a workflow/user experience change by monitoring issues with the `~UX` label.
 - Engineering clarifying the issue description as stated, and refines and weights the issue once Product and UX have provided enough details to do so.
 - Tech writing reviewing issues for documentation additions/edits and adding perspective on UI text by monitoring issues with the `~"Technical Writing"` label. (Experimental during FY22Q4)

At any point, if an issue becomes blocked, it would be in the `workflow::blocked` status. If there is a blocking issue, it needs to be added to the issue description or linked to the issue with a 'blocked by' relationship.

`workflow::ready for development` means that an issue has been sufficiently [refined and weighted by Engineering](##how-engineering-refines-issues), upon request by Product and UX

`workflow::awaiting security release` is applied by an engineer after the security issue has passed verification and this label signals that it is ready for production but awaiting the next [monthly security release](/handbook/security/#timing-of-the-monthly-security-release). When this label is applied, the issue's milestone should also be updated to the next milestone to align with when the next security release will happen.

`workflow::feature-flagged` is applied to an issue that is being enabled through a separate feature flag rollout issue. Once the feature is validated the status is moved to `workflow::production` and the issue is closed.
 
`Closed` means that all code changes associated with the issue are fully enabled on gitlab.com. If it is being rolled out behind a feature flag, it means the feature flag is enabled for all users on gitlab.com.

More detail on the workflow is available on the [Product-Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) page.

### "What do I work on next?"

#### What are the priorities for this milestone?

We use a series of labels to indicate the highest priority issues in the milestone.

1. The highest priorities for a given milestone would be issues labelled with `Verify::P1`, `Deliverable` and `group::pipeline execution` to align with the Theme and Goals of the milestone.
1. Once all of the `Verify::P1` issues have been picked up and are in `workflow:in dev` or beyond, we have `Verify::P2` and `Verify::P3` to signal issues that are important and may become `Verify::P1` issues in later milestones.

Beyond the product `Verify::PX` priorities, the `ready for development` column will be stack ranked (or at least reviewed) daily by the Product Manager, so that each team member can pull from the top of the column expecting that it is already ordered in priority.

To make sure we ship complete solutions in a [timely manner](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/641753/UX-Debt) and contribute to the [overall CI/CD UX strategy](/handbook/product/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/#strategy) we strive to close UX Debt Quickly. We try to dedicate a certain percentage (~10%) of our capacity by weight in each milestone to working on [ux debt](/handbook/product/ux/performance-indicators/#ux-debt) labeled issues and address them within their SLOs. We select items from the list of [open UX debt issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=UX%20debt&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution) for pipeline execution. Our goal is to close the high severity [open UX debt issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=UX%20debt&label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution) and reduce the open UX Debt age from 620 to (at or below) 150 days.

When DRIs select issues, they will assign themselves to the issue and also add the milestone that they believe the issue will most likely be shipped. This is also a good time to re-evaluate the weight and proposal, in case the DRI picking up the issue was not the same individual who originally weighted and refined the issue. Assigning a milestone to an issue does not necessarily mean that the issue is being started on that same milestone. Aspriationally, we strive to iterate and want to break down the efforts to ship as much value in the milestone for our users as possible, which means if you see a more efficient way forward when you start working on a new issue, free to raise a comment and update the proposal to deliver more iterative value. 

#### Working Right to Left to reduce WIP

Each member of the team can choose which issues to work on during a milestone by assigning the issue to themselves.  When the milestone is well underway and we find ourselves looking for work, we default to working **right to left** on the **issue board** by pulling issues in the right-most column. If there is an issue that a team member can help with on the board, they should do so instead of starting new work. This includes conducting code review on issues that the team member may not be assigned to, if they feel that they can add value and help move the issue along to completion. Additionally, prior to picking up the next issue from the top of the `workflow::ready for development` column, team members should check the [`~needs weight` board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4178322?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=needs%20weight) to ensure everything in the current milestone has been weighted.

Specifically, this means our work is prioritized in the following order:
 * Any verification on code that is in `workflow::verification` or `workflow::production`
 * Conducting code reviews on issues that are `workflow::in review`
 * Unblocking anyone in `workflow::blocked` or `workflow::in dev` if applicable
 * Check the [`~needs weight` board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4178322?label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=needs%20weight) for any issues needing to be weighted in current milestone.
 * Then, picking from the top of the `workflow::ready for development` column

The goal of this process is to reduce the amount of work in progress (WIP) at any given time. Reducing WIP forces us to "Start less, finish more", and it also reduces cycle time. Engineers should keep in mind that the DRI for a merge request is **the author(s)**, to reflect the importance of teamwork without diluting the notion that having a [DRI is encouraged by our values](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#dris-and-our-values).

#### Splitting issues

If an issue has several components (e.g. ~frontend, ~backend, or ~documentation) it may be useful to split it up into separate implementation issues.
The original issue should hold all the discussion around the feature, with the implementation issues being used to track the work done.
Doing this provides several benefits:

1. There's only one DRI per issue.
1. Workflow labels and health statuses are more relevant.
1. We can weight issues with more accuracy.
1. We can mark one implementation as a blocker for another.
1. It's easier to see what work can be picked up by each functional group.
1. We can schedule feature work across multiple milestones.

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/includes/splitting_issues.erb") %>

Please use implementation issues responsibly.
They make sense for larger issues, but can be cumbersome for smaller features.

#### Weekly Issue Progress Updates

In order to keep our stakeholders informed of work in progress, we provide updates to issues either by updating the issue's **health status** and/or adding an **async issue update**.

##### Issue Health Status

For issues in the current milestone, we use the [Issue Health Status feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/#health-status) to indicate probability that an issue will ship in the current milestone. This status is updated by the DRI ([directly responsible individual](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/)) as soon as they recognize the probability has changed. If there is no change to the status, a comment to indicate that it has been the status of the issue has been _assessed_ would be helpful. 

The following are definitions of the health status options:

- `On Track` - The issue has no current blockers, and is likely to be completed in the current milestone.
- `Needs Attention` - The issue is still likely to be completed in the current milestone, but there are setbacks or time constraints that could cause the issue to miss the release due dates.
- `At Risk` - The issue is highly **unlikely** to be completed in the current milestone, and will probably miss the release due dates.

Examples of how status updates are added:
1. If the health status changes from `On Track` to `Needs attention` or `At Risk`, we recommend that the DRI add a short comment stating the reason for the change in an [issue status update](#issue-status-updates).
1. If an issue continues to be `On Track`, the DRI could provide a comment to indicate solutions (whatever it may be) continue to be implemented, and it's still _on track_ to be delivered in the same milestone.

##### Issue status updates

When the DRI is actively working on an issue  (workflow status is `workflow::in dev`, `~workflow::in review` or `workflow::verification` in the current milestone), they will add a comment into the issue with a status update, detailing:
- the updated issue health status
- notes on what was done based on the updated issue health status (especially if not `On Track`)
- anything else the DRI feels is beneficial to reflect the progress

There are several benefits to this approach:

- Team members can better identify what they can do to help the issue move along the board
- Creates an opening for other team members to engage and collaborate if they have ideas
- Leaving a status update is a good prompt to ask questions and start a discussion
- The wider GitLab community can more easily follow along with product development
- A history of the roadblocks the issue encountered is readily available in case of retrospection
- Product and Engineering Managers are more easily able to keep informed of the progress of work

Expectations for DRIs when providing updates for work in progress:

- Status updates are provided once per week, barring special circumstances (e.g. PTO)
- Ideally updates are made at a logical part of a DRI's workflow to minimize disruption, and not necessarily at the same time/day each week
  - Generally when there is a logical time to leave an update, such as a _change in issue health status_, that is the best time to do so
  - Can be used to present some technical findings or information relevant to other stakeholders

##### Tracking Inactive Issues

As a general rule, any issues being actively worked on have one of the following workflow labels:

- `workflow::in dev`
- `workflow::in review`
- `workflow::verification`
- `workflow::complete` (upon **closing** the issue)

The Health Status of these issues should be updated to:

1. `Needs Attention` - on the `1st` of the month.
1. `At Risk` - on the `8th` of the month.

EMs are responsible for manually updating the Health Status of [any inactive issues in the milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Acontinuous%20integration&milestone_title=%23upcoming&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Acanary&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Ain+dev&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Ain+review&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Aproduction&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Astaging&not%5Blabel_name%5D%5B%5D=workflow%3A%3Averification&page=2&scope=all&state=opened) accordingly.

### Spikes

Spikes are time-boxed investigations typically performed in agile software development. We create Spike issues when there is uncertainty on how to proceed on a feature from a technical perspective before a feature is developed.

#### Guidelines

- Spikes are typically marked as deliverable to ensure clear ownership from engineers
- Spikes are typically time-boxed to a short duration, sometimes one week, never more than one milestone.
- We should try to schedule Spikes at the beginning of an iteration so that the investigation will conclude before the planning of the following iteration.
- Limit no more than 2 Spikes per milestone per group. 
- Typically multiple team members collaborate on a spike. We want to ensure we get multiple different viewpoints as well as keep the research focused and efficient.
- Spikes should be assigned to at least one frontend and one backend engineer to ensure we consider the issue from both viewpoints.

#### Category Labels

The Pipeline Execution group supports the product marketing categories described below:

### Developing with Feature Flags

When building features that may have high impact the team uses established [GitLab guidelines](/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/) for feature flags.

We also ensure we are collaborating with our teammates in customer support and customer success by [alerting them](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/controls.html#communicate-the-change) to the rollout issue before a feature is enabled.

The feature flags introduced by the team still in the code can be found in this table.

<embed width="100%" height="400px" src="<%= signed_periscope_url(chart: 10522908, dashboard: 792066, embed: 'v2', filters:[{"name": "team_group", "value": "pipeline execution"}]) %>">

You can also search all Feature Flags through Sam's great [tool here](https://samdbeckham.gitlab.io/feature-flags/#%5B%7B%22type%22:%22group%22,%22value%22:%7B%22data%22:%22group::pipeline%C2%A0execution%22,%22operator%22:%22=%22%7D%7D,%7B%22type%22:%22filtered-search-term%22,%22value%22:%7B%22data%22:%22%22%7D%7D%5D) (prefiltered for pipeline exeuction)

### Collaboration with UX and Engineering

To create a high-quality product that is functional and useful – Engineering, PM and Product Designer work closely together, combine methodologies, and often connect throughout the product development process. They use `workflow::design` to discuss possible complexities, challenges, and uncover blockers around the proposed solution. 

Product Designers play a critical role in the product development of user-facing issues. They collaborate with the Engineering and the Product Manager to design the user experience for the features. Once the design solution is proposed, agreed and validated, the Engineering [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) is assigned to implement that design and functionality during the milestone for which the issue is planned.

Following the [code review guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#approval-guidelines) means that we should ensure all MRs with user facing changes are reviewed by a product designer. UX reviews should follow [the designer review guidelines](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/mr-reviews/) as closely as possible to reduce the impact on velocity while maintaining quality.

#### Inclusive Development

Our process of planning and development relies heavily on overcommunication rather than any approval gates or automated notification mechanisms. We adhere to the proactive mindset and responsibility of everyone involved to make sure every step in the process is as transparent as it can be. For both planning and building this means direct, cross-functional, and other relevant stakeholders are included early into the process. This ensures everyone is able to contribute to the best of their capabilities, and at the right time in the process. This can include, but is not limited to, GitLab objects, Slack, meetings, and daily stand-ups.

Some practical examples of this are:
- When you open up or begin working on an epic, issue, or merge request, consider if all stakeholders are aware of this or should be updated. If unsure, error on the side of updating rather than keeping silent.
- When making significant progress make sure this is seen by the relevant stakeholders even if you don't require immediate feedback by mentioning them rather than relying on automated email notifications. Make their involvement explicit.

Note: For issues related to Merge Request experience, always keep [the Code Review group](/handbook/product/categories/#code-review-group) in the loop to avoid any technical or UX debt from occurring. Refer to the [collaboration on merge requests experience](/handbook/product/cross-stage-features/merge-requests/) page to learn more about the collaboration framework.

Note: A good practice when only wanting to inform rather than requesting a direct action from the mentioned stakeholders is to put `FYI` directly following the @mention handle.

#### UX Scorecards 

A top priority for us is usability, and one way to effectively evaluate our [JTBDs](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-execution/jtbd/) is with periodic [UX Scorecards](/handbook/product/ux/ux-scorecards/). For technical tasks that require infrastructure support, such as a functional cluster or provisioned environment with a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, the Product Designer and the Product Manager can work with the Engineering Manager and Quality stable counterparts to craft a project based on the scenarios to test for the JTBDs. Some guidelines for working together in this case: 

- Be sure to schedule _at least_ a full milestone in advance, so there is enough lead time for the stable counterparts
- Create an overall epic and add issues for task tracking for infrastructure creation
- Schedule a kick off or record a walkthrough of the scenarios for everyone to have a shared understanding of the JTBD that are being evaluated

We are also working on maintaining a library of precreated tasks for contribution from the engineering team in the [CI Sample Projects group](https://gitlab.com/ci-sample-projects). These will help avoid having too much overhead from UX Scorecards and Category Maturity Scorecards in the future.

#### Breaking down issues for iteration

We follow the steps below to achieve the best results in the shortest time:

1. After user research or customer feedback identifies a user need, and has generated some ideas to meet that need, the Product Designer drives the process of moving those ideas into design proposals involving the PM and the Engineering Team early and often. The [UX Definition of Done](/handbook/product/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/pipeline-execution/) can be referenced to give counterparts better insight into which steps in the design workflow need to be completed before the MVC can move to the development phase.
1. Depending on our confidence in the proposed solution, we may take those prototypes through user testing to validate if they would solve the original problem.
1. Engineers, the Product Designer, EM and PM can compare and contrast multiple possible engineering approaches to decide which one to work on first based on the scope of the solutions and experience of the team.
1. When a solution is validated and the team has a clear understanding of the effort required, it is time to break the big solution down into smaller issues. This is usually done in the `workflow::planning breakdown` phase and the whole team (PM, Engineers, Product Designer, QA, and Technical Writer) is involved in the process. They work closely together to find the most technically feasible and smallest feature set to deliver value to early customers and provide feedback for future product development. Check out [iteration strategies](#iteration-strategies) for help.

We aim to design broadly for an epic or full feature at least one milestone ahead of time and then break the big solution into smaller issues to pick up in the next milestones.
Suppose working one milestone ahead to design the big solution is not possible. In that case, Engineering and Product Designer will define the first most technically feasible and smallest feature set ([MVC](/handbook/values/#minimal-viable-change-mvc)) to satisfy early customers that will be implemented in the same milestone.

#### Avoiding crunch times between UX, Product and Engineering

* Ideally, Product Management and Product Designers aim to work 3 months in advance of Engineering proposals to ensure the problem definition and solution has been adequately validated prior to building. See [Validation track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-track) for more details. This allows us to come up with the bigger idea ahead of time, and work further with Engineering to break it down into smaller iterations. Ideally, this should be completed before the implementation milestone starts.
* the Product Designer, PM, and Engineering use the [Design phase](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-3-design) in the Validation track to talk about complexities and discuss challenges and uncover blockers. Once we are all in agreement, we can move it to the [Solution Validation phase](/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-4-solution-validation).
* If it is taking more than a week to understand and investigate the technical feasibility for the design solution, update the workflow label to `~workflow::blocked` and change the assignee to engineering DRIs until the technical discussion is resolved. If the discussion is expected to go on longer, reducing the chances of the design solution being delivered in the intended milestone, consider creating [a spike issue](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-execution/#spikes) for the discussion that blocks the current issue. 
* Engineers and Product Designers should stay in contact and frequently align throughout the [Build track](/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) to avoid unplanned changes.

#### Collaborating with the Wider Community on Community Merge Requests

For more details on how to contribute to GitLab generally, please see our [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/). 

#### Aligning on feature development

The Engineering DRI works with the Product Designer throughout the `workflow:in dev` phase to uncover possible problems with the solution early enough that exhibit unexpected behaviour to what was originally agreed upon. If there are changes to be added that weren't agreed upon in the initial issue - a followup issue should be made and the Engineering DRI should work with the Product Manager to schedule that issue in a following milestone. This allows us to focus on [cleanup over signoff](/handbook/values/#cleanup-over-sign-off), iterate quickly on issues with [a low level of shame](/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame), and still make sure we accomplish what we've agreed upon. We should be careful not to hold off on completing these followup issues so that we don't build up a significant amount of UX debt issues.

If we find that solutions are consistently not matching the agreed upon design, we will hold a retrospective with the DRI, designer, and product manager to discuss where the gaps in communication are so that we can improve. It may be necessary to begin requiring a UX approval for merge requests on certain issues to help the Engineering DRI meet the requirements.



### Collaborating with other Product Groups at GitLab

We strive to be as collaborative as possible in our work because the scope of our product area touches many other groups, including Create:Source Code and Verify:Runner. To enable collaboration we may work together with other internal stakeholders on a single MR to update or create a feature and documentation. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76253 is an example of how this can work very well.

### E2E Tests

Whenever possible, engineers should add all relevant tests alongside a new feature or a bug fix.
It is always required that engineers should add all relevant tests (unit, component, integration or E2E) alongside a new feature or a bug fix.
We recognize, however, that in the case of creating E2E tests this cannot be applied systematically for multiple reasons. This section
lists some ways we work to deliver tests in a painless and efficient way.

#### Plan ahead

We aim to define needed tests early with [Quad-planning](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-authoring/#quad-planning).
All the testing should be defined before the implementation starts and all parties should agree on:
- What type of test coverage is needed.
- Who is the DRI for which test.
- What is to be delivered.
- When it will be delivered.
  - If Feature flag is required consider [strategy for testing feature flags in end to end tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/issues/782)

#### E2E tests are written in parallel

When writing a new feature, we might need to write new E2E specs. In Pipeline Execution, we prefer
to add E2E tests in separate MRs, the same way we prefer frontend and backend MRs to be separate.
During [Quad-planning](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-authoring/#quad-planning), it is essential
to determine whether that separate MR is required for the feature to ship or not. Given that we use feature flags for all
new features, it is quite easy to work in separate MRs and turn on the flag when the team feels the feature has enough coverage
for production use. A typical full stack feature can therefore involve multiple backend MRs, then frontend MRs, and finally
E2E test MRs.

#### Best person for the job

Writing tests is a team effort and should never be delegated to a single group. We are all responsible for quality.
That being said, we acknowledge that Software Engineers in Tests (SETs) have the most knowledge about writing E2E tests. A benefit
of splitting the E2E specs into a separate MR is that it can be assigned to someone other than the DRI of the
feature, which lets a more appropriate person write the spec. This can be the SET, backend or
frontend, depending on the circumstances.

Given the Ruby expertise required to write E2E tests, we should have SETs and backend engineers be the primary team members to
write them. Frontend engineer may volunteer to write them with the support of a SET if they feel
confident, but it is **not expected** of them.

Whenever possible, backend engineers should help write the E2E tests of a new feature or bug fix.
They should feel comfortable pinging the SET on their team as needed (to review the MR, for example).
This helps alleviate the SET's workload, so that they are not entirely responsible for E2E tests on their own.
However when they are not comfortable writing the required E2E tests, then the plan should be for
the SET to lead the effort. The rationale being that SETs have the most context and work daily with specs,
so they will be able to write them much faster. More importantly, they can write much **better** specs.
DRI engineers should proactively help the SET understand the required tests.

#### Accounting for capacity

In the instance where the SET has too many E2E tests to write, then they should check with
backend engineers of the team if they could lead the effort on some of them. Because testing
is part of the required work, we should account for E2E tests when assigning issues to a milestone.

#### Bug fixes that require additional test coverage

When we fix a bug, we ideally want to write a test that would catch and prevent this bug from happening again in the future.
However, if the spec we need to write (unit, integration, or E2E test), is part of a code change that needs to be merged as
soon as possible (e.g. requires a time sensitive resolution), it is preferable to merge the fix first, 
and create an issue to write the spec afterwards, so that it is not blocking merging of the MR. This example should be considered the
exception, not the rule.

#### Creating follow-up issues for specs

When creating follow-up issues for tests, we have to ensure that they are not going to sit on a pile in the backlog.
Tests are essential and should be prioritized as such.
When creating a follow-up issue for required tests:
- Make sure to assign the issue to the following milestone and make room for it to be worked on.
- Add all the context necessary to test the feature in the description, for example: Where it is, how it works, how to configure it, etc.
- Assign a DRI immediately and cc the product manager so that they are aware of the issue and required work.

### Bugs

As a group, we strive to meet the [Severity Service Level Objective](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity-slos) of bugs. We regularly review all bugs and prioritize issues with a `~missed-SLO` label and those approaching SLO (Service Level Objective) through our weekly [Triage Report](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#group-level-bugs-features-and-ux-debt). One of the group's goals is to reduce the median age of open S2 bugs which is being tracked by the Quality department as a [KPI](/handbook/engineering/quality/performance-indicators/#s2-oba). To do this we will triage aged bugs each milestone closing what we can, reducing severity for bugs mis-labeled, asking for more details for issues that cannot be reproduced and prioritizing those that can be reproduced focusing on bugs in the identified [JTBD](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-execution/jtbd/).

### Features 

When we build new features, in line with our Iteration value, we aim for an MVC that covers the core aspect of the feature. 
Then we create issues with `~feature::enhancement` label to iterate on the remaining functionality. The more a new feature is used, the more missing functionality eventually can be perceived as bugs by the users.

We use `severity::1`, `severity::2`, `severity::3` and `severity::4` labels with `~feature::enhancement` to classify the impact of those issues to prevent them from becoming `~type::bug`.
We use the list below as a guideline to grade the impact.

| Label         | Definition           | Description |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `severity::1` | Blocking or Critical | The enhancement is critical to the core of the feature. The feature is currently incomplete or extra action is required. |
| `severity::2` | High                 | Some important aspects of the feature are missing but the feature delivers value. However the missing behavior can make the feature appear buggy. |
| `severity::3` | Medium               | The feature works ok but the enhancement is required under less common scenarios. |
| `severity::4` | Low                  | The feature works fine and the improvement aims to improve customer satisfaction. |

### Technical debt

We track our technical debt using the following [Pipeline Execution Technical Debt issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1438885), where we track issues in the planning phase.

This board has 2 main sections:

1. Issue readiness
    - In `workflow::planning breakdown` we find issues that are currently being refined.
    - In `workflow::ready for development` we find issues that clearly defined and a weight has been assigned.

1. Impact breakdown. We use `severity::1`, `severity::2`, `severity::3` and `severity::4` labels to classify the impact of the specific tech debt item.
   We use the list below as a guideline to grade the impact.
    - `severity::1` Blocking or Critical
      - blocking debt that prevents any further changes in the area
      - we stumble on the same complex code every single time and it causes serious slow down on development
      - the problem exists in a core part of our domain that represents a dependency for a large number of features
      - the problem is wide spread throughout several domains
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::1` bugs
    - `severity::2` High
      - blocks many changes in the area or makes them difficult to work around it
      - the problem exists in an area that changes frequently, causing it or workarounds to spread easily
      - the problem is related to an important feature (e.g multi-project pipelines)
      - the problem is very common in a specific domain and leaks into other domains too
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::2` bugs
    - `severity::3` Medium
      - the problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain
      - the problem exists in an area that does not change frequently
      - the problem is very common in a specific domain but limited to its domain boundaries
      - workarounds slow down development
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::3` bugs
    - `severity::4` Low
      - the problem is very isolated and has low or no impact to development
      - the area affected does not change frequently
      - the problem is related to a number of reported `severity::4` bugs

1. Issue scheduling. The Engineering Manager(s) will review the [PE Technical Debt issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/3567075?scope=all&label_name[]=group%3A%3Apipeline%20execution&label_name[]=technical%20debt&assignee_id=None) and recommend issues to schedule for upcoming milestones by adding them to the [planning issue](#planning) for a milestone or communicating with Product a need to schedule the issue in an upcoming milestone. The team strives to have 20% of a sprint's capacity filled with Tech Debt issues.

Note that multiple factors can exist at once. In that case use your judgment to either bump the impact score or lower it. For example:
- The problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain but it's related to a number of `severity::2` bugs.
  Then choose `severity::2`.
- The problem is related to an important feature but the workaround is acceptable as the code around it does not
  change frequently. Then choose `severity::3`.

### Risk Mapping

To better understand the risk environment and each risk's causes and consequences, the Pipeline Execution team uses the [Risk Map](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/pipeline-execution/risk-map/) as our risk management tool to prioritise mitigation strategies and increase Quality.

## Developer Onboarding

Welcome to the team! Whether you're joining GitLab as a new hire, transferring internally or ramping up on the CI domain knowledge to tackle issues in our area, you'll be assigned an [onboarding/shadowing buddy](/company/culture/all-remote/onboarding/#how-to-onboard-new-hires-remotely) so you can have someone to work with as you're getting familiarized with our codebase, our tech stack and general development processes on the Pipeline Execution team.

Read over this page as a starting point, and feel free to set up regular sync or async conversations with your buddy. We recommend setting up weekly touch points at a minimum, and joining our regular team syncs to learn more about how we work. (Reach out to our Engineering Managers for an invite to those recurring meetings). You're also welcome to schedule a few coffee chats to meet some members of our team. There is also a [Pipeline Execution Developer onboarding checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/onboarding/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/verify-pipeline-execution_developer-onboarding.md) for you to go through if it's helpful, which will have admin tasks to complete (as a new team member, if relevant), and also links to technical documentation, meeting agendas and recordings.

Issues labelled with `~onboarding` are smaller issues to help you get onboarded into the CI feature area. We typically work Kanban, so if there aren't [any `~onboarding` issues in the current milestone](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1372896?milestone_title=%23started&label_name[]=onboarding), reach out to the Product Manager and/or Engineering Managers to see which issues you can start on as part of your onboarding period.

In May 2021, we introduced the [CI Shadow Program](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2542), which we are trialing as a way to onboard existing GitLab team members from other Engineering teams to the CI domain and contribute to CI features.
