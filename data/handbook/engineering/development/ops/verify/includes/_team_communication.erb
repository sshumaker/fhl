The team is globally distributed and separated by many timezones.  This presents some challenges in how we communicate since our work days only overlap by a couple hours.  We have decided as a team to embrace asynchronous communication because scheduling meetings is difficult to coordinate.  We meet as a team one day per week, on Wednesdays for a team meeting and our team's Engineering Managers schedule regular 1-on-1s.

- We are pro-active about asking questions in advance with the understanding that the turnaround on receiving an answer is usually 1-2 working days, subject to one's workload.
- Our engineering plan and issue boards need to be updated regularly to communicate what stage our work is in.
- Any meetings that we hold need a preset agenda and are recorded for folks who are unable to attend.
- Having a positive work/life balance, despite these challenges, must be a high priority and handled intentionally so no one is routinely starting early or staying late to attend meetings.

#### How to work with us

##### Slack

Daily standup updates are posted to [`#<%= slack_channel %>`](<%= slack_url %>).

Feel free to ask us questions directly in this Slack channel and someone will likely get back to you in 1-2 working days.  We will use following emojis to respond to the posted question accordingly:
 * ![eyes](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-large/1f440@2x.png){:height="20px" width="20px"} -- `:eyes:` to indicate that one of us has seen it
 * ![checkmark](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/apple-large/2705@2x.png){:height="20px" width="20px"} -- `:white_check_mark:` to indicate that the question has been answered

The verify stage has a separate Slack channel under [`#s_verify`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C0SFP840G), which encompasses the other groups of Verify.

##### GitLab Issues and MRs

Most spontaneous team communiation happens in issues and MRs. Our issues have a group label of [`~"<%= group_label %>"`](<%= group_issues_url %>).  You can also tag a team member with `@mention` in the issue if you have someone specific to ask.

If you need to call the attention of the entire group, you can tag `@gitlab-com/<%= gitlab_subgroup %>`.
