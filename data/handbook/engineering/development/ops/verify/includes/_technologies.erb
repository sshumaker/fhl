Like most GitLab backend teams we spend a lot of time working in Rails on the main [GitLab CE app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce), but we also do a lot of work in Go which is the language that [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner) is written in. Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.
