## Overview

The goal of this page is to create, share and iterate on the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) and their corresponding job statements for the Release group. Our goal is to utilize the JTBD framework to better understand our buyers' and users' needs.

## Goals

Utilize JTBD and job statements to:

- Understand our users' motivations.
- Validate identified use cases and solutions.
- Continuously test and iterate features to ensure we are meeting our customers' and users' needs.
- Create a transparent view for our stakeholders into the current and future state of the product.

## Challenges

- GitLab is not particularly competitive for the non-technical release manager who is used to using tools with a strong calendar view and lots of plug ins to the technical activities. JTBDs will help us hone in the tasks these users need to successfully use our tools
- K8 orchestration is easy and very natural in our offerings today. Extending these capabilities for all deployments will increase our reach and growth.
