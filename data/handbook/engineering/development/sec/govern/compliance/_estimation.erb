Before work can begin on an issue, we should estimate it first after a preliminary investigation.

If the scope of work of a given issue touches several disciplines (docs, design, frontend, backend, etc.) and involves significant complexity across them, consider creating separate issues for each discipline (see [an example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9288)).

Issues without a weight should be assigned the "workflow::planning breakdown" label.

When estimating development work, please assign an issue an appropriate weight:

| Weight | Description (Engineering) |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | The simplest possible change. We are confident there will be no side effects. |
| 2 | A simple change (minimal code changes), where we understand all of the requirements. |
| 3 | A simple change, but the code footprint is bigger (e.g. lots of different files, or tests affected). The requirements are clear. |
| 5 | A more complex change that will impact multiple areas of the codebase, there may also be some refactoring involved. Requirements are understood but you feel there are likely to be some gaps along the way. We should challenge ourselves to break this issue in to smaller pieces. |
| 8 | A complex change, that will involve much of the codebase or will require lots of input from others to determine the requirements. These issues will often need further investigation or discovery before being `~workflow::ready for development` and we will likely benefit from multiple, smaller issues. |
| 13 | A significant change that may have dependencies (other teams or third-parties) and we likely still don't understand all of the requirements. It's unlikely we would commit to this in a milestone, and the preference would be to further clarify requirements and/or break in to smaller Issues. |

As part of estimation, if you feel the issue is in an appropriate state for an engineer to start working on it, please add the ~"workflow::ready for development" label. Alternatively, if there are still requirements to be defined or questions to be answered that you feel an engineer won't be able to easily resolve, please add the ~"workflow::blocked" label. Issues with the `workflow::blocked` label will appear in their own column on our planning board, making it clear that they need further attention. When applying the `workflow::blocked` label, please make sure to leave a comment and ping the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) on the blocked issue and/or link the blocking issue to raise visibility.
