Depending on the complexity of an issue, it may be necessary to break down or promote issues. A couple sample scenarios may be:

- We need to do discovery on the design, before we do anything else. A "Discovery:" issue may work best here as it helps to contain the design thinking and discussion there, with the end result being transferred over to a "Implementation:" issue. These prefixes also help to organize what type of issue they are, in the case they are linked to parent issues or epics.
- The scope of work is larger than anticipated, and needs to be broken down further, e.g., it currently has a weight higher than 5. It may suit you to then promote said issue to an epic, to break it down into smaller issues to list out the different iterations or phases of work that need to happen to deliver the overall feature that was originally proposed.
- The scope of work is clear, but a bit unwieldy for one issue. It may make sense to keep the given issue as is, to keep the conversation and activity visible to everyone, but create separate child design, backend, or frontend issues to track the more nuanced progress of a given issue.

If none of the above applies, then the issue is probably fine as-is! It's likely then that the weight of this issue is quite low, e.g., 1-2.
