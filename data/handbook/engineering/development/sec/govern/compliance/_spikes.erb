We use [spikes](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#spikes) to conduct research, prototype, investigation to gain knowledge, reduce the risk of a technical approach, and better understand a requirement.

When we identify the need for a spike, we will create a new issue, clearly label it as such [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353606), conduct the spike, and document the findings in the spike issue.

Spikes are great for accounting for ad-hoc work and questions that can come through during a Milestone. A rule of thumb, if the work will take longer than 1-2 hours, then create a spike issue. 

Spike issues, like any other issue, will go through the [cross-functional prioritization process](#milestone-planning) to get it planned, scheduled, and completed.

Before working on a spike we make sure to clearly define:
1. A time-box of how much time to spend on the issue.
1. A clear question or problem that needs to be delivered.
