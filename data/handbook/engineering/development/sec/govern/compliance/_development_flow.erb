We generally follow the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#workflow-summary):
1. `workflow::problem validation` - needs clarity on the problem to solve
1. `workflow::design` - needs a clear proposal (and mockups for any visual aspects)
1. `workflow::solution validation` - needs refinement and acceptance from engineering
1. `workflow::planning breakdown` - needs a Weight estimate
1. `workflow::scheduling` - needs a milestone assignment
1. `workflow::ready for development`
1. `workflow::in dev`
1. `workflow::in review`
1. `workflow::verification` - code is in production and pending verification by the [DRI](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) engineer
1. `workflow::complete` - the work has been verified and the work is complete, the issue should be closed at this stage

Generally speaking, issues are in one of two states:
* Discovery/refinement (1-4): we're still answering questions that prevent us from starting development,
* Implementation (6-9): an issue is waiting for an engineer to work on it, or is actively being built.

Basecamp thinks about these stages in relation to the [climb and descent of a hill](https://www.feltpresence.com/hills.html).

While individual groups are free to use as many stages in the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/#workflow-summary) workflow as they find useful, we should be somewhat prescriptive on how issues transition from discovery/refinement to implementation.
