### Govern:Compliance
{: #welcome}

## What we work on
* We use the [Group Direction page](/direction/govern/compliance/) to describe our high-level goals and direction for our group.
* From the high-level goals and direction we filter down to a prioritised list of Epics and Issue, that we use when planning each Milestone. This prioritised list we try to keep updated in our [Planning Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/govern/compliance/-/epics/2)
  * In addition to using the high-level goals and direction as an input to planning Milestones, the Compliance Product Manager considers input from Sales, customers, and internal stakeholders (dogfooding) to decide on the priority for the issues added to each Milestone.
* We also use [OKRs](/company/okrs/) to help prioritise strategic initiatives within the group. We use Issues for planning and collate them in our [OKR Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/govern/compliance/-/epics/4)

## How we work
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values/).
* Transparently: nearly everything is public, we record/livestream meetings whenever possible.
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on.
* Everyone can contribute; no silos.
  * The goal is to have product give engineering and design the opportunity to be involved with direction and issue definition from the very beginning.
* We do an optional, asynchronous daily stand-up in our stand-up channel:
  * Govern:Compliance [#g_govern_compliance_daily](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C013E163FD0)

### Code Review
<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/code_review.erb") %>

### Working on ad hoc work and questions
From time to time, there will be ad hoc work and questions that arise, such as Slack questions, questions in Issues, Error Budget investigations, etc. All Compliance group members are encouraged to watch these mediums and engage.

As first responder, we will acknowledge the ad hoc work / question in the appropriate medium. This is to ensure that the questioner knows that we are on it.

Similar to [Spikes](#spikes), as a rule of thumb, if the work will take longer than 1 hour to investigate and respond, then create an issue. This is to ensure that this work is accounted for, is transparent and has a DRI. This can be done through asking the questioner to create an issue, or taking ownership and creating the issue ourselves.

We try to ensure that the ad hoc work Issue has as much info as possible, asking for more info where required. Before working on an Issue, we make sure to define a clear question or problem that needs to be delivered.

Next, we take ownership of the Issue, assigning it to ourselves. We also add the :eyes: reaction to the Slack message/Issue comment to indicate that investigation has begun. We also ensure correct label hygiene (~type::, ~group::, ~priority::, ~workflow::). In the comments, ping the Compliance EM and PM to ensure transparency. Depending on priority, it may need to go through [cross-functional prioritization process](#milestone-planning) to get it planned, scheduled, and completed.

Once the investigation is complete, we follow up in the original medium. We also add the :white_check_mark: reaction to the original Slack message/Issue comment to indicate that investigation is complete.

## Milestone Planning
We plan in monthly cycles in accordance with our [Product Development Timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline). Our typical planning cycle is suggested to look like:

### Pre-planning
<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/pre_planning.erb") %>

### Planning
<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/planning.erb") %>

### Issue Prioritization

## During Milestone
<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/release.erb") %>

### Development Flow

### Discovery/Refinement

#### Estimation

#### Implmentation Plan

#### Breaking down or promoting issues
<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/compliance/promote_issues.erb") %>

#### Demos
During the `workflow::verification` process, we determine whether the Issue requires a demo. If unsure, work with PM to determine if a demo is required. Demos are great for showcasing progress and help users quickly understand how to use a features and its benefits. Our process for this is similar to [Single Engineer Groups Demo](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/demos/#single-engineer-groups-demo):

- Record a video on your computer or via Zoom livestream of the working software
- Upload to the [GitLab Unfiltered Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A) and add to the [Compliance Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kq7_yBKIYHi8qvCWeU0Q3yH)
- Post the YouTube link to the appropriate Slack channel and in the Issue
