## Team members

<%= direct_team(role_regexp: /Vulnerability Research/, manager_role: 'Manager, Vulnerability Research Engineering') %>

### Area of focus

Team members on the Vulnerability Research team normally have an area
 of focus where they spend most of their time. They have
 [stable counterparts](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/16/an-ode-to-stable-counterparts/)
 in development and product management in those areas of focus to stay
 aligned on direction across teams.

| Team member                        | Area of focus | Dev stable counterpart(s)                                      | PM stable counterpart(s) |

## Top-level Responsibilities

* Perform security research and develop proofs of concept that
 strengthen GitLab's security product offerings, with a particular
 focus on advancing analyzer maturity. 
* Maintain the advisory database(s)
 ([Gitlab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) 
 and [GitLab Advisory Database (Open Source Edition)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/advisories-community)).
* Carry out [CNA](/security/cve/) duties.

## Mission

Vulnerability Research is a research & development team. While not being 
a product team, our work directly impacts the product. Our mission is to 
perform security research and develop proofs of concept that increase the 
capabilities and effectiveness of the [Sec section](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/). 
Additionally, the team's mission is to share security expertise and practical 
experience. To learn more about the latter, you can follow updates to our 
[brown-bag sessions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/brown-bag-sessions) 
and the Gitlab blog ([#security](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#security), 
[#security-research](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#security-research), 
[#vulnerability-research](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/tags.html#vulnerability-research) 
tags in particular).

## Vision

* Drive innovative tools and techniques for identifying security
  issues and vulnerabilities.
* Leverage information security expertise to make new discoveries.
* Be a fixture of innovation within the security community.

@TODO: Update the strategy/vision for FY22+. Perhaps,
link to the proposed Direction page for VR.
-->
### Short-term

* Keep on improving the advisory database(s) automation and maintenance.

### Mid-term

* Start graduating proofs of concept into products.
* Improve the current Sec section feature set. Focus on
 [DAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/)
 and [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/).

### Long-term

* Continue developing innovative features that may be integrated
 into the Sec section.


## Time allocation

Vulnerability researchers spend ~80% of their time on proofs of concept
 and free-form research in their areas of focus, working closely with
 their stable counterparts in development and product management. 20%
 of their time is split between Keeping the Lights On and free-form
 research that may be outside their areas of focus.

## POC Validation
The vulnerability research team seeks to internally validate all proofs
 of concept. Successful iterations of developed tools that are aligned
 with Sec Section product roadmap can then be transitioned into the
 product and made available to the wider GitLab community.

The [Application Security team](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/)
 plays a key role in this process by a) providing insight into user
 needs via their direct experience managing the security program at
 GitLab), and b) by being the first customer to try out proposed
 security capabilities.


## Processes

* [CNA Processes](cna.html). Gitlab is a [CNA](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/terminology/#cna).

### Priorities

The Vulnerability Research team uses the standard priority labels to
 determine priority, however those may carry a different meaning
 compared to the [usage in product teams](/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#prioritizing-technical-decisions):

| Label          | Color  | Meaning |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| `~priority::1` | red    | The most critical task. Normally, only hull breaches should prompt a P1. Synonymous with incident. Examples: CNA/GemnasiumDB automation broke and needs to be fixed ASAP. |
| `~priority::2` | orange | Top-priority work. |
| `~priority::3` | yellow | A "roadmap" item. Large projects that we work on for months fall into this category. |
| `~priority::4` | green  | Tasks like discovery, nice-to-have PoCs, anything that we won't loose much by letting it sit there in the backlog. |

Any unlabeled issues are considered unprioritized, i.e. lowest-priority
 backlog.
