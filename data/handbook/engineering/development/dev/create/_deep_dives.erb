The groups in the [Create stage][stage] organize regular [Deep Dive sessions]
to share our domain specific knowledge with others in the stage, the organization,
and the wider community. All existing Deep Dives can be found on [GitLab Unfiltered][Youtube]
with slides and recordings in the descriptions. For Create specific Deep Dives, there is a
[different playlist][Create playlist]. To find more information on upcoming sessions, 
or to propose a new topic, please see the [epic][Deep Dive issue tracker].
