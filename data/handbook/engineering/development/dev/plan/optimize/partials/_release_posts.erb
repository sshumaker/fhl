For issues which need to be announced in more detail, a release post can be automatically created using the issue.
When working on an issue, either in planning, or during design and development, you can use the
[release post item generator](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#release-post-item-generator)
to have the release post created and notify all the relevant people.

If you do not want an issue to have a release post, make sure that the issue does not have a
release notes section or use a `release post item::` label.
