* When an issue is introduced into a release after Kickoff, an equal amount of weight must be removed to account for the unplanned work.
* Development should not begin on an issue before it's been estimated and given a weight.
* By the 15th, engineering merge requests should be merged. In other words, we assume code merged after the 15th will not be in the release. That allows time for the release to be finalized, and any associated [Release Posts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/) to be merged by the 17th. (This is an [experiment starting with 13.11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/general-discussion/-/issues/17330).)
