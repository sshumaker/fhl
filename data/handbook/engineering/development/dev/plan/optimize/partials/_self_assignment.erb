During planning, the EM may assign issues to individual engineers when it makes sense, but in general the issues will remain unassigned and left for engineers to self assign once planning has been finalized.

Expectations by role:

* EM to ping engineers on the planning issue once finalized.
* Engineers to self assign issues before the start of the release.
* EM to highlight unassigned issues during weekly team call.
