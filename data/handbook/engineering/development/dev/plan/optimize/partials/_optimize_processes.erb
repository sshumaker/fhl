#### Capacity planning

During planning we don't plan 100% of the team's capacity to go into deliverable work each milestone. Instead, we reserve a buffer of 15% per team member to allow for more time to research and scope work.

#### Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of our [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done). For any change that requires technical writing, we will add the documentation label. The documentation label should be used in addition to backend/frontend labels. If a feature justifies separate backend and frontend issues, the documentation label should be applied to each issue if applicable. An issue may only get resolved if all the work has been merged, i.e., the technical part and the documentation change.
