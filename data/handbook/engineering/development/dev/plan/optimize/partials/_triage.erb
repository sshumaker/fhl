We generally follow the [Issue Triage](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage) guidelines.

Expectations by role:

* PM is the DRI for `type::feature`
* EM is the DRI for `type::bug`
* UX supports the decision around severity labels for issues with `UX`, `UX debt`, and `SUS`
  * Where the UX severity and PM/EM severity is different, we take the [higher severity of the two](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#examples-of-severity-levels).
* Engineers are encouraged to participate 

On a weekly basis, we aim to triage as many issues as possible. We strive to perform a [complete triage](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#complete-triage) on issues requiring triage.
