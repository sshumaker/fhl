We have useful dashboards tracking the performance of parts of the application we're responsible for:

- Application dashboards; showing request throughput, latency, SQL query counts, cache hits, Sidekiq jobs for Web and API endpoints, git usage and error budgets. Also links to other useful resources in Kibana.
  - [Certify]
- The [Sitespeed Dashboard]; showing the results of ongoing synthetic tests against representative product pages. Useful for identifying changes in page load time (TTFB), LCP, etc.
