## Plan:Certify team

The Plan:Certify team works on both the backend and frontend parts of
GitLab's [Certify] categories in the [Plan stage].

For more details about the vision for this area of the product, see the
[Plan stage] page.

### Capacity Planning

#### Weighing bugs

### Collaborating across disciplines

#### Health Status

To help with visibility of whether or not an issue can be delivered in a milestone, the team uses health status to communicate quickly.
At the beginning of a milestone, all issues relating to the primary deliverable are assigned the "On track" status. Throughout the milestone, feature DRIs are responsible for updating issues statuses when necessary. If the health status is set to a status that is not "On Track", feature DRIs should leave a comment with additional details about why and if there's a way others on the team can help.
Using health status allows stakeholders, such as product and engineering managers, designers, and other engineers, to get a quick and easy overview of what is unlikely to make it into the current milestone.

#### Documentation

Documentation should accompany code for any [new or changed functionality] as per our
[definition of done]. This can become tricky when collaborating on a feature that is
behind a feature flag.

Since all feature flags start as disabled by default, we should aim to document the
feature as soon as it's safe for testing by users using the [feature flag template].
Don't wait until a feature is performant and stable to document it, instead do so once
it's secure and won't leave data in a corrupt, interim state.

Try to include docs with the first MR to introduce usable functionality. If this is
an API addition with no UI, document that and allow the FE engineers to update it as
work proceeds. As the feature flag rollout proceeds, the [documentation should be updated].

This avoids the rush to provide documentation that often accompanies the release cutoff.

### Picking something to work on

The team [Build Board] always shows work in the current
release, with [workflow columns] relevant to implementation. Filtering it by
~backend shows issues for backend engineers to work on.

It's OK to not take the top item if you are not confident you can solve
it, but please post in [#s_plan] if that's the case, as this probably
means the issue should be better specified.

[workflow columns]: /handbook/product-development-flow/
[Build Board]: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1569369?not[milestone_title]=Backlog
[#s_plan]: https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/s_plan

### Direction Items

Items that are customer-facing deliverables and high impact are labeled with ~"direction". We strive to have these items in production by two days before the release cut-off to give ample time for validation.

#### High Severity Issues

<%= partial("handbook/engineering/development/dev/plan/high_severity_items") %>

### Working on unscheduled issues

Everyone at GitLab has the freedom to manage their work as they see fit,
because [we measure results, not hours][results]. Part of this is the
opportunity to work on items that aren't scheduled as part of the
regular monthly release. This is mostly a reiteration of items elsewhere
in the handbook, and it is here to make those explicit:

1. We expect people to be [managers of one][efficiency], and we [use
   GitLab ourselves][collaboration]. If you see something that you think
   is important, you can [request for it to be scheduled], or you can
   [work on a proposal yourself][iteration], as long as you keep your
   other tasks in mind.
2. From time to time, there are events that GitLab team-members can participate
   in, like the [issue bash]. Anyone is welcome
   to participate in these.
3. If you feel like you want to have some specific time set aside, but
   aren't interested in the topics of an existing event, feel free to
   label issues with "For Scheduling" and copy your manager for visibility.

When you pick something to work on, please:

1. Follow the standard workflow and assign it to yourself.
2. Share it in [#s_plan] - if not even more widely (like in #development
   or #backend).

## Contractors for Service Desk (starting Q4 FY23)

In December 2022 we started hiring contractors who will be working on Service Desk. In total, we'll hire 10 contractors with the following distribution:

| Quarter | Role | Quantity|  
| ------ | ------ |------ |
|2023 Q4 | Backend Engineer |  2  |
|2023 Q4 | Frontend Engineer |  1  |  
|2023 Q4 | Senior Backend Engineer |  2  |  
|2023 Q4 | Senior Frontend Engineer |  1  |  
|2023 Q4 | Scrummaster  |  1  |
|2023 Q4 | UX Designer |  1  |      
|2024 | Product Manager  |  1  |      
|2024 | Engineering Manager  |  1  |  
| 2024 | Engineering | TBD |

NOTE: FY 2024 planning is underway and should be finalized by January 2024. Data in this table represents our proposal.


They will be working on Service Desk issues with `Contractor Contribution` label. The issues will be linked to the [Accelerate Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9452).

### Work coordination

For filtering issues to work on, we use [Issue List filtered by labels](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Contractor%20Contribution&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AService%20Desk&first_page_size=20) and for the development workflow there is [Service Desk Improvements issue Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/5085983).

Weekly sync calls between Certify PM & EM and Scrummaster joining as a contractor will be scheduled. Agenda for these calls can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AsuekuG2mcy9Hs4AQ9WPLztobt9PICwyo4tU4JMK3b8/edit).

### Service Desk transition 

While contractors are being hired for Certify in the beginning and will start on this group the plan is to move them to the Monitor stage. 

Details about the transition can be found in the [transition plan issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/5171#note_1202172208).
