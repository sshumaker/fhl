## Career Chats

The Integrations group members hold "career chats" with their manager at least two times a year. The purpose is to have each team member take some time to think about his or her career goals and development opportunities and share those with his or her manager.

More information about career development can be found on the [Learning and Development - Career Development handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/).

### A Note About Ownership

No one is more invested in your future than you. Because of that, career development is the team member's responsibility.

According to the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/), each team member is responsible for:

- Take charge of your own development and career
- Close the skill gap for current and future positions
- Seize development and stretch opportunities
- Remember there are no promises or guarantees of a promotion

Your manager will:

- Take time with team members to discuss their career aspirations
- Listen and provide feedback, ideas and contacts
- Make choices to support their development

### Agenda

1. Review any previous action items and update the status.
1. Review any changes in careeer goals since previous career chat.
1. Discuss the big question: Where do you see yourself in one, three, or five years?

Do not think in terms of job titles, instead focus on what you would like to be doing and where you are headed. 

### Starter Questions

If you need help thinking about your career, here are some "starter questions" to get you thinking:

- Do you want to manage people or would you prefer being an individual contributor?
- Do you want to stretch into a new area or become an expert in a current field?
- What skills do you want to develop?
- What experiences do you want to have?
- What knowledge would you like to acquire?
- Are you hoping for a promotion, new assignment, or a new role in a different area?
- How have your career goals changed in the past six months?
