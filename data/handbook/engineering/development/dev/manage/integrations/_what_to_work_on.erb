Issues are usually not directly assigned to people, except in cases
where there is clearly a most appropriate person to work on them, like in the
case of technical debt, bugs related to work someone did recently, or issues
someone started on before but hasn't had a chance to finish yet.

#### What to work on first

Deliverables are considered top priority and are expected to be done by the end
of the iteration cycle on the 17th, in time for the release on the 22nd.

The primary source for things to work on is the [Integrations issue board][issue board]
for the current iteration cycle, which lists all of the
Deliverable and Stretch issues scheduled for this cycle in priority order. They
should be picked up starting at the top. When you assign yourself to an issue, you indicate
that you are working on it.

If anything is blocking you from getting started with the top issue immediately,
like unanswered questions or unclear requirements, you can skip it and consider
a lower priority issue, as long as you put your findings and questions in the
issue, so that the next engineer who comes around may find it in a better state.

Generally, you work about 75% of the time on Deliverables. The other 25%
is set aside for other responsibilities (code review, community merge request
coaching, [helping people out in Slack, participating in discussions in
issues][collaboration], etc), as well as urgent issues that come up during the
month and need someone working on them immediately (regressions, security
issues, customer issues, etc).

#### What if a Deliverable cannot be completed in a cycle?

Many things can happen during a month that can result in a Deliverable
not actually being completed by the end of a cycle, and while this usually
indicates that the team was too optimistic in their estimation
of the issue's weight, or that an engineer's other responsibilities ended up
taking up more time than expected, this should never come as a surprise to the
Product Manager or to the Engineering Manager.

The sooner this potential outcome is anticipated and communicated, the more time
there is to see if anything can be done to prevent it, like reducing the scope
of the Deliverable, or finding a different engineer who may have more time to
finish a Deliverable that hasn't been started yet.
If this outcome cannot be averted and the Deliverable ends up missing the
cycle, it will simply be moved to the next cycle to be finished up, and the
engineer and Engineering Manager will have a chance to
[retrospect](#retrospectives) and learn from what happened.

#### What to work on next

If there are no more unassigned Deliverables, first offer to assist other engineers
with their Deliverables. Next, you can spend the remaining time working on Stretch issues.

These lower priority issues are _not_ expected to be done by the end of the
iteration cycle, but are to be Deliverables in the _next_ cycle, so any progress
made on them ahead of time is a bonus.

Instead of picking up Stretch issues, you may also choose to spend any
spare time working on anything else that you believe will have a significant
positive impact on the product or the company in general.
As the [general guidelines] state, "we recognize that inspiration is
perishable, so if youâ€™re enthusiastic about something that generates great
results in relatively little time feel free to work on that."

We expect people to be [managers of one][efficiency] and prefer [responsibility
over rigidity][efficiency], so there's no need to ask for permission if you
decide to work on something that's not on the issue board, but please keep your
other responsibilities in mind, and make sure that there is an issue, you are
assigned to it, and consider sharing it in [#g_manage_integrations](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/g_manage_integrations).
