We have 1 regularly scheduled "Per Milestone" retrospective, and can have ad-hoc "Per Project" retrospectives.

#### Per Milestone

The Integrations group conducts [milestone retrospectives in GitLab
issues][retros]. These include the engineers, UX, PM, and
all stable counterparts who have worked with that team during the milestone.

Participation by the Integrations team members is highly encouraged for every milestone.

These are confidential during the initial discussion, then made public in time
for each month's [GitLab retrospective]. For more information, see [group
retrospectives].

#### Per Project

If a particular issue, feature, or other sort of project turns into a
particularly useful learning experience, we may hold a synchronous or
asynchronous retrospective to learn from it. If you feel like something you're
working on deserves a retrospective:

1. [Create an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/integrations/team/-/issues) explaining why you want to have a retrospective and indicate whether this should be synchronous or asynchronous.
2. Include your EM and anyone else who should be involved (PM, counterparts, etc).
3. Coordinate a synchronous meeting if applicable.

All feedback from the retrospective should ultimately end up in the issue for reference purposes.
