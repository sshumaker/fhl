#### Career development

Career development for each engineering team member is described [here](/handbook/engineering/career-development).

Topic of career development is discussed between team member and engineering manager during their 1:1 meetings.
Current goals, pace of development,
a method of tracking goals, and frequency of check-ins are agreed between team members and their EM.

If a team member is working towards promotion within the next 12 months, it is recommended they track progress against their desired [job description](/job-families/engineering/development/).

Team members are encouraged to track their achievements using [Value Based Tracker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBjEbX-p4MYinEsdU-91KDQ_BJkihwrBKZ0n9yfdLjo/edit).
