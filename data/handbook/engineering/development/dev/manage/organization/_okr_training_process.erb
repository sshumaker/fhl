#### OKR trainings

Different pieces of training are often part of OKRs. To facilitate tracking those training and in the spirit of dogfooding our product,
following participation in the training is tracked through the issue in [Manage:Organization project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/manage/manage-organization).

At the beginning of the quarter, when OKR is due, the Engineering Manager is responsible for starting the issue.
The issue should consist of a link to the training, an explanation of why the OKR was set and checkboxes for all the team members.
Also, the due date needs to be set. Then all of the team members are mentioned in the issue for awareness.

Based on the checkboxes, the Engineering Manager updates the OKR in GitLab.
