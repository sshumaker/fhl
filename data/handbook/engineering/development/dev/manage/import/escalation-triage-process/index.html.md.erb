## Manage::Import Escalation Triage
{: #welcome}

Due to known [reliability problems](/direction/manage/importers/#reliability)
with our existing importers, the Import group frequently receives support requests to investigate
and resolve failed or incomplete imports. The purpose of this escalation triage process is to
decrease the resolution time by doing the following:

- Introduces a Single Source of Truth to track progress towards a resolution.
- Helps all stakeholders to fully understand the problem and determine who is involved in triage.
- Improves communication and accountability by clearly identifying a DRI from each department.
- Allows Engineering to properly prioritize any open escalation(s) against the current backlog of work.

## Process

Define an escalation manager. The escalation manager is responsible for:

- Keeping all involved groups informed.
- Ensuring transparency in all involved groups.
- Creating communication sync points when needed.

To request support from the group, [create a new issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/dev-sub-department/section-dev-request-for-help/-/issues/new?issuable_template=SupportRequestTemplate-Import).
Note the use of the Support Request issue template.

**Note:** If as part of your investigation you believe you have identified a feature addition,
improvement, or bug, we encourage you to also create an issue detailing your findings in the main
[GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new).
You can reference this from your support issue.

Upon creation of the support issue, the relevant team members are notified and begin to triage and
prioritize the escalation within 2 working days.
