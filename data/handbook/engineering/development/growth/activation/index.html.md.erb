## Vision

The Activation Group is part of the [Growth Stage]. We work on [connecting our users with our product value](/handbook/marketing/growth/).

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

Questions should start by @ mentioning the Product Manager for the [Activation group](/handbook/product/categories/#activation-group)
or creating a new issue in the Growth Product [Activation issues] list.

## Mission

The Growth:Activation Group works on product priorities with our [Growth product managers](/handbook/product/growth/)
and contributes to Growth initiatives including the [Registration Flow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4745)
and [Continuous onboarding](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4817).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Growth:Activation team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition and Activation', role_regexp: /(Activation)/) %>

### Stable Counterparts

We work directly with the following team members in the Growth:Activation group:

<%=
other_manager_roles = ['Director of Engineering for Growth, Sec, and Data Science','Senior Engineering Manager, Anti-Abuse, Govern, and Growth']
direct_managers_role = 'Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition and Activation'
roles_regexp = /[,&] (Growth(?!:)|Growth:Activation)/

stable_counterparts(role_regexp: roles_regexp, direct_manager_role: direct_managers_role, other_manager_roles: other_manager_roles)
%>

## How We Work

* We're data savvy
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values)
* Transparently: nearly everything is public
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on
* Everyone can contribute; no silos

### Prioritization

Prioritization is a collaboration between Product, UX, and Engineering.

* We use the [ICE framework](/handbook/marketing/growth/) for experiments.
* We use [Priority](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels)
  and [Severity](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels) labels for bugs.

### Workflow

We use the [Product Development workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) when working on issues and
merge requests across multiple projects.

We use the Activation development [workflow board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/3558733?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Aactivation) for work in the build phase of the product development flow.
