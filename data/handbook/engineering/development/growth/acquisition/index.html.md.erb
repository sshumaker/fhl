## Vision

The Acquisition Group is part of the [Growth Stage]. We work on [connecting our users with our product value](/handbook/marketing/growth/).

* I have a question. Who do I ask?

Questions should start by @ mentioning the Product Manager for the [Acquisition group](/handbook/product/categories/#acquisition-group)
or creating a new issue in the Growth Product [Acquisition issues] list.

## Mission

The Growth:Acquisition Group works on product priorities and [growth deliverables](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/growth/#growth-deliverables)
with our [Growth product managers](/handbook/product/growth/)
and contributes to Growth initiatives including the [Registration Flow](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4745)
and [Continuous onboarding](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4817).

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Growth:Acquisition team:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition and Activation', role_regexp: /(Acquisition)/) %>

### Stable Counterparts

We work directly with the following team members in the Growth:Acquisition group:

<%=
other_manager_roles = ['Director of Engineering for Growth, Sec, and Data Science','Senior Engineering Manager, Anti-Abuse, Govern, and Growth']
direct_managers_role = 'Fullstack Engineering Manager, Growth:Acquisition and Activation'
roles_regexp = /[,&] (Growth(?!:)|Growth:Acquisition)/

stable_counterparts(role_regexp: roles_regexp, direct_manager_role: direct_managers_role, other_manager_roles: other_manager_roles)
%>

## How We Work

* We're data savvy
* In accordance with our [GitLab values](/handbook/values)
* Transparently: nearly everything is public
* We get a chance to work on the things we want to work on
* Everyone can contribute; no silos

### Prioritization

Prioritization is a collaboration between Product, UX, Engineering, and Quality.

* We use the [ICE framework](/handbook/marketing/growth/) for experiments
* We use [Priority](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#priority-labels)
  and [Severity](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html#severity-labels) labels for bugs

<%= partial "handbook/engineering/metrics/partials/_cross_functional_dashboard.erb", locals: { filter_value: "Acquisition" } %>

### Workflow

* We use the [Product Development workflow](/handbook/product-development-flow/) when working on issues and
merge requests across multiple projects.

* We use a shared [Kanban workflow board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4152639) for both groups - Acquisition and Activation
for work in the [build phase](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#build-track) of the product development flow.

* We use [refinement threads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383859#note_1231645373) on issues to discuss our approach and estimate weight of upcoming work.
