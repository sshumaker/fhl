## Mission

Our mission is to improve software delivery performance for mobile developers and teams by enabling [DevOps capabilities](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/technical) for mobile software delivery.

## Vision

The vision for GitLab Mobile DevOps is to be the easiest way to `build`, `test`, `sign`, and `release` a mobile application. We do this by creating automation and tooling to enable a CI/CD pipeline with only a few clicks. While also helping teams to avoid confusing and brittle custom CI scripts or relying on a single engineerâ€™s laptop to do all of the releases.

## Approach

### Building Blocks

As we work towards our fully-automated vision, we will start by creating building blocks that can be used independently or combined with other tools to create powerful automations. As these building blocks mature, they will become the basis for the automated delivery pipeline features.

### Fastlane

[Fastlane](http://fastlane.tools/) is the most popular open-source tool for mobile application development and release automation. We will utilize Fastlane in our automations and tools, and contribute to the open source project whenever possible. Please see our [recent contributions](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adarbyfrey) for more details.

## Competitive Landscape

There are several competitors in this space providing visual pipeline builders on top of their own CI/CD systems (Bitrise, Appcircle, and Codemagic) and the more prominent players, including Visual Studio App Center, Firebase, and AWS Mobile Services.

## Jobs to be Done

### Goals

Utilize JTBD and job statements to:

* Understand our users' underlying motivations
* Validate identified problem areas within the Mobile DevOps experience
* Create a common language across teams for better collaboration when working on improving the experience for GitLab Mobile DevOps
* Create a transparent view for our stakeholders into the current and future state of the product

### JTBD

#### Choose a build environment

Once I have an Android or iOS application created, I want to be able to easily choose a build environment for my CI jobs so that I can be confident that my builds will behave as expected.

| Job statements | Maturity | Research | Roadmap |
|----------------|----------|----------|---------|
| When setting up a CI build for my Android application, I want an easy way to configure the build environment, including the SDK version and dependencies, so that I can quickly have a successful CI build running. | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SCORE----yellow"> | [Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/readme/-/issues/100) | [Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/readme/-/issues/103) |
