## GitLab Flow

Products at GitLab are built using the [GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html).

We have [specific rules around code review](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/).

## Reverting a merge request

In line with our values of [short toes](/handbook/values/#short-toes), [making two-way-door decisions](/handbook/values/#make-two-way-door-decisions)
and [bias for action](/handbook/values/#bias-for-action), anyone can
propose to revert a merge request. When deciding whether an MR should be reverted,
the following should be true:

* Something broke and there is no acceptable work around. Examples of this include:
  * A feature broke and is categorized as `~severity::1` or `~severity::2`.
  [See severity labels](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity)
  * [Master broken](#broken-master)
  * There are failing migrations
* There are no dependencies on the change. For example, a database
migration has not been run on production.

Reverting merge requests that add non-functional changes and don't remove any existing capabilities
should be avoided in order to prevent designing by committee.

The intent of a revert is never to place blame on the original author. Additionally, it is helpful
to inform the original author so they can participate as a DRI on any necessary follow up actions.

The `pipeline:expedite` label, and `master:broken` or `master:foss-broken` label must be set on merge requests that fix `master` to skip some non-essential jobs in order to speed up the MR pipelines.

## Broken `master`

If you notice that pipelines for the `master` branch of [GitLab] or [GitLab FOSS] are failing, returning the build to a passing state takes priority over everything else development related, since everything we do while tests are broken may:

- break existing functionality
- introduce new bugs and security issues
- impede productivity for all of engineering and our release processes

[GitLab]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab
[GitLab FOSS]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss

### What is a broken `master`?

A broken master is an event where a pipeline in `master` is failing.

The cost to fix test failures increases exponentially as time passes due to [merged results pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.html) used. Auto-deploys, as well as monthly releases and security releases, depend on `gitlab-org/gitlab` master being green for tagging and [merging of backports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/release-manager.md#regular-security-releases).

Our aim should be to keep `master` free from failures, not to fix `master` only after it breaks.

### Broken `master` service level objectives

There are two phases for fixing a broken `master` incident which have a target SLO to clarify the urgency. The resolution phase is dependent on the completion of the triage phase.

| Phase | Service level objective | DRI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Triage](#triage-broken-master) | 4 hours from the initial broken `master` incident creation until assignment | Engineering Productivity team |
| [Resolution](#resolution-of-broken-master) | 4 hours from assignment to DRI until incident is resolved | Merge request author or team of merge request author or dev on-call engineer |

Additional details about the phases are listed below.

### Broken `master` escalation

If a broken `master` is blocking your team (such as creating a security release) then you should:

1. See if there is a non-resolved [broken `master` incident](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/master-broken-incidents/-/issues) with a DRI assigned and check discussions there.
1. Check discussions on the failure notification in the Slack [`#master-broken`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CR6QH3D7C) channel. If there isn't a discussion, ask in `#master-broken` if there's anyone investigating the incident you are looking at
1. If there is not a clear DRI or action to resolve then use the [dev escalation](/handbook/engineering/development/processes/Infra-Dev-Escalation/process.html) process to solicit help in the broken `master` incident.

### Triage broken master

The [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/) is the triage DRI for monitoring, identification, and communication of broken `master` incidents.

#### Triage DRI Responsibilities

1. Monitor
   * Pipeline failures are sent to [`#master-broken`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CR6QH3D7C) and will be reviewed by the team.
   * If the incident is a duplicate of an existing incident, use the following quick actions to close the duplicate incident:

      ```shell
      /assign me
      /duplicate #<original_issue_id>
      /copy_metadata #<original_issue_id>
      ```

   * If the incident is not a duplicate, and needs some investigation:
     * Assign the incident to yourself: `/assign me`
     * Change the incident status to `Acknowledged` (in the right-side menu).
     * In Slack, the `:ack:` emoji reaction should be applied by the triage DRI to signal the linked incident status has been changed to `Acknowledged` and the incident is actively being triaged.

1. Identification
   * Review non-resolved [broken `master` incidents](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/master-broken-incidents/-/issues) for the same failure. If the broken `master` is related to a test failure, [search the spec file in the issue search](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?sort=created_desc&state=opened&label_name[]=failure::flaky-test) to see if there's a known `failure::flaky-test` issue.
   * If this incident is **due to non-flaky reasons**, communicate in `#development`, `#backend`, and `#frontend` using the Slack Workflow.
      * Click the "lightning bolt" shortcut icon in the `#master-broken` channel and select `Broadcast Master Broken`, then click `Continue the broadcast`.
      * [Create a revert MR directly](#reverting-a-merge-request) to save some time in case we need to revert down the line.
        * If you are reverting an MR that performs a database migration, you need to follow the [Deployment blockers process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/deployments-and-releases/deployments/#deployment-blockers) to prevent the migration from proceeding to deploy and running on staging and production. 
        * If the migration is executed in any environments, communicate to the release managers in `#releases` channel and discuss whether it's appropriate to create another migration to roll back the first migration or turn the migration into a no-op by following [Disabling a data migration steps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/database/deleting_migrations.html#how-to-disable-a-data-migration).
   * If you identified that `master` fails **for a flaky reason**, and it cannot be reliably reproduced (i.e. running the failing spec locally or retry the failing job), create an issue from the `New issue` button in top-right of the failing job page (that will automatically add a link to the job in the issue), and apply the `Broken Master - Flaky` description template.
      * Create a new Timeline event in the incident with a link to the created issue.
      * Add the appropriate labels to the main incident:

        ```shell
        # Add those labels
        /label ~"master-broken::flaky-test" 
        /label ~"failure::flaky-test" 

        # Pick one of those labels
        /label ~"flaky-test::dataset-specific" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::datetime-sensitive" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::ordering assertion" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::random input" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::transient bug" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::unclean environment" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::unreliable dom selector" 
        /label ~"flaky-test::unstable infrastructure" 
        ```

      * Close the incident
   * Add the stacktrace of the error to the incident, as well as Capybara screenshots if available in the job artifacts.
     * To find the screenshot: download the job artifact, and copy the screenshot in `artifacts/tmp/capybara` to the incident if one is available.
   * Identify the merge request that introduced the failures. There are a few possible approaches to try:
      * Check the commit in the failed job, and find the associated MR, if any (itâ€™s not as simple most of the times though).
      * [Look at the project activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/activity), and search for keywords in the recent merged events.
      * [Look at the recent commits on master](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commits/master) and search for keywords you might see in the failing job/specs (e.g. if you see a `geo` spec file is failing, specifically the `shard` spec, search for those keywords in the commit history).
        * You can [filter with the `Merge branch` text](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commits/master?search=Merge%20branch) to only see merge commits.
      * Look at the spec file history or blame views, by clicking respectively the `History` or `Blame` button at the top of a file in the file explorer, e.g. at <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/backup.rb>.
    * If you identified a merge request, assign the incident to its author if they are available at the moment. If they are not available, assign to the maintainer that approved/merged the MR. If none are available, mention the team Engineering Manager and seek assistance in the `#development` Slack channel.
      * You can find the team somebody is in and who's the manager for that team by searching in https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/.
    * If no merge request was identified, ask for assistance in the `#development` Slack channel.
    * Please set the appropriate `~master-broken:*` label from the list below:

      ```shell
      /label ~"master-broken::caching" 
      /label ~"master-broken::ci-config" 
      /label ~"master-broken::dependency-upgrade"
      /label ~"master-broken::flaky-test" 
      /label ~"master-broken::fork-repo-test-gap" 
      /label ~"master-broken::pipeline-skipped-before-merge"
      /label ~"master-broken::test-selection-gap"
      /label ~"master-broken::need-merge-train"
      /label ~"master-broken::infrastructure"
      /label ~"master-broken::runner-disk-full"
      /label ~"master-broken::undetermined"
      ```

    * When the master-broken is resolved, close the incident.
2. (Optional) Pre-resolution
   * If the triage DRI believes that there's an easy resolution by either:
     * Reverting a particular merge request.
     * Making a quick fix (for example, one line or a few similar simple changes in a few lines).
     The triage DRI can create a merge request, assign to any available maintainer,
     and ping the resolution DRI with a `@username FYI` message.
     Additionally, a message can be posted in `#backend_maintainers` or `#frontend_maintainers` to get a maintainer take a look at the fix ASAP.

### Resolution of broken master

The merge request author of the change that broke `master` is the resolution DRI.
In the event the merge request author is not available, the team of the merge request author will assume the resolution DRI responsibilities.
If a DRI has not acknowledged or signaled working on a fix, any developer can take assume the resolution DRI responsibilities by assigning themselves to the incident.

#### Responsibilities of the resolution DRI

1. Prioritize resolving broken `master` incidents over new bug/feature work. Resolution options include:
   * **Default**: Revert the merge request which caused the broken `master`. If a revert is performed,
     create an issue to reinstate the merge request and assign it to the author
     of the reverted merge request.
       * Reverts can go straight to maintainer review and require 1 maintainer approval.
       * The maintainer can request additional review/approvals if the revert is not trivial.
       * The `pipeline:expedite` label, and `master:broken` or `master:foss-broken` label must be set on merge requests that fix `master` to skip some non-essential jobs in order to speed up the MR pipelines.
   * [Quarantine](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/flaky_tests.html#quarantined-tests) the failing test if you can confirm that it is flaky (e.g. it wasn't touched recently and passed after retrying the failed job).
     * Add the `quarantined test` label to the `failure::flaky-test` issue you previously created during the identification phase.
   * Create a new merge request to fix the failure if revert is not possible or would introduce additional risk. This should be treated as a `priority::1` `severity::1` issue.
     * To ensure efficient review of the fix, the merge request should only contain the minimum change needed to fix the failure. Additional refactor or improvement to the code should be done as a follow-up.
1. Apply the `Pick into auto-deploy` label (along with the needed `severity::1` and `priority::1`) to make sure deployments are unblocked.
1. If the broken `master` incident affects any stable branches (e.g. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/25274>) or is caused by a flaky failure,
   open new merge requests **directly against the active stable branches** and ping the current release manager in the merge requests to avoid
   delays in releases / security releases.
   See [How to fix a broken stable branch guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/how-to-fix-broken-stable-branch.md) for more details.
1. Communicate in `#master-broken` when the fix was merged
1. Once the incident is resolved, click the "lightning bolt" shortcut icon in the `#master-broken` channel and select `Broadcast Master Fixed`, then click `Continue the broadcast`.
1. When `master` build was failing and the underlying problem was quarantined /
   reverted / temporary workaround created but the root cause still needs to be
   discovered, the investigation should continue directly in the incident.
1. Create an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/new) for the [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/) describing how the broken `master` incident could have been prevented in the Merge Request pipeline.

#### Responsibilities of authors and maintainers

Once the resolution DRI announces that `master` is fixed:

* Maintainers should start a new merged results pipeline (for canonical MRs)
  and enable "Merge When Pipeline Succeeds" (MWPS).
  There's no need to rebase once `master` has been fixed since we use [merged results pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.html).
* (For forks only) Authors should rebase their open merge requests (since
  [merged results pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.html)
  isn't supported in these cases).

### Merging during broken master

Merge requests **can not be merged** to `master` until the incident status is changed to `Resolved`.

This is because we need to try hard to avoid introducing **new** failures,
since it's easy to lose confidence if it stays red for a long time.

In the rare case where a merge request is [urgent](#criteria-for-merging-during-broken-master)
and must be merged **immediately**, team members can follow the process below to have a merge
request merged during a broken `master`.

#### Criteria for merging during broken master

Merging while `master` is broken can only be done for:

- Merge requests that need to be deployed to GitLab.com to alleviate an ongoing production incident.
- Merge requests that fix broken `master` issues (we can have multiple broken `master` issues ongoing).

#### How to request a merge during a broken `master`

First, ensure the latest pipeline has completed less than 2 hours ago (although it is likely to have have failed due to
`gitlab-org/gitlab` using
[merged results pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.html)).

Next, make a request on Slack:

1. Post to either the `#frontend_maintainers` _or_ `#backend_maintainers` Slack
   channels (whichever one is more relevant).
1. In your post outline _why_ the merge request is [urgent](#criteria-for-merging-during-broken-master).
1. Make it clear that this would be a merge during a broken `master`, optionally add a link to this
   page in your request.

#### Instructions for the maintainer

A maintainer who sees a request to merge during a broken `master` must follow this process.

Note, if any part of the process below disqualifies a merge request from being merged
during a broken `master` then the maintainer must inform the requestor as to _why_ in the
merge request (and optionally in the Slack thread of the request).

First, assess the request:

1. Add the `:eyes:` emoji to the Slack post so other maintainers know it is being assessed.
   We do not want multiple maintainers to work on fulfilling the request.
1. Assess whether the merge request [is urgent or not](#criteria-for-merging-during-broken-master). If in doubt, ask the requestor for more
   details in the merge request about why it is urgent.

Next, ensure that all the following conditions are met:

1. The latest pipeline has completed less than 2 hours ago (although it is likely to have failed due to
   `gitlab-org/gitlab` using
   [merged results pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merged_results_pipelines.html)).
1. All of the latest pipeline failures also happen on `master`.
1. There is a corresponding non-resolved [broken `master` incidents](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/engineering-productivity/master-broken-incidents/-/issues).
   See the "Triage DRI Responsibilities" steps above for more details.

Next, add a comment to the merge request mentioning that the merge request will be merged
during a broken `master`, and link to the broken `master` incident. For example:

```md
Merge request will be merged while `master` is broken.

Failure in <JOB_URL> happens in `master` and is being worked on in <INCIDENT_URL>.
```

Next, merge the merge request:

- If the "Merge" button is enabled (this is unlikely), then click it.
- Otherwise, you must:
  1. Unset the
    ["Pipelines must succeed" setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html#require-a-successful-pipeline-for-merge)
    for the [`gitlab-org/gitlab` project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/edit).
  1. Click the "Merge" button.
  1. Set the "Pipelines must succeed" setting to be on again.

### Broken `master` mirrors

[`#master-broken-mirrors`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C01PK38VAN8) was created to remove duplicative notifications from the `#master-broken` channel which provides a space for [Release Managers](https://about.gitlab.com/community/release-managers/) and the [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/) to monitor failures for the following projects:

- <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab>
- <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-ee>

The `#master-broken-mirrors` channel is to be used to identify unique failures for those projects and flaky failures are not expected to be retried/reacted to in the same way as `#master-broken`.

## Security Issues

Security issues are managed and prioritized by the security team. If you are assigned to work on a security issue in a milestone,
you need to follow the [Security Release process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md).

If you find a security issue in GitLab, create a **confidential issue** mentioning the relevant security and engineering managers, and post about it in `#security`.

If you accidentally push security commits to `gitlab-org/gitlab`, we recommend that you:

1. Delete the relevant branch ASAP
2. Inform a release manager in `#releases`. It may be possible to execute a garbage collection (via the Housekeeping task in the repository settings) to remove the commits.

For more information on how the entire process works for security releases, see the
[documentation on security releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/master/general/security/process.md).

## Basics

1. Start working on an issue youâ€™re assigned to. If youâ€™re not assigned to any issue, find the issue with the highest priority and relevant label you can work on, and assign it to yourself. [You can use this query, which sorts by priority for the started milestones][priority-issues], and filter by the label for your team.
1. If you need to schedule something or prioritize it, apply the appropriate labels (see [Scheduling issues](#scheduling-issues)).
1. If you are working on an issue that touches on areas outside of your expertise, be sure to mention someone in the other group(s) as soon as you start working on it. This allows others to give you early feedback, which should save you time in the long run.
1. If you are working on an issue that requires access to specific features, systems, or groups, open an [access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Access_Change_Request) to obtain access on staging and production for testing your changes after they are merged.
1. When you start working on an issue:
  - Add the `workflow::in dev` label to the issue.
  - Create a merge request (MR) by clicking on the **Create merge request** button in the issue. This creates a MR with the labels, milestone and title of the issue. It also relates the just created MR to the issue.
  - Assign the MR to yourself.
  - Work on the MR until it is ready, it meets GitLab's [definition of done](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done), and the pipeline succeeds.
  - Edit the description and click on the **Remove the Draft: prefix from the title** button.
  - Assign it to the suggested reviewer(s) from [Reviewer Roulette](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#reviewer-roulette). If there are reviewers for multiple categories, for example: frontend, backend and database, assign all of them. Alternatively, assign someone who specifically needs to review. When assigning, also @mention them in the comments, requesting a review.
  - (Optionally) Unassign yourself from the MR. Some may find leaving the MR assigned to themselves easier to track the MRs they are responsible for by using the built in MR button/notification icon in the GitLab navigation bar.
  - Change the workflow label of the issue to `workflow::in review`. If multiple people are working on the issue or multiple workflow labels might apply, consider breaking the issue up. Otherwise, default to the workflow label farthest away from completion.
  - Potentially, a reviewer offers feedback and assigns back to the author.
  - The author addresses the feedback and this goes back and forth until all reviewers approve the MR.
  - After approving, the reviewer in each category unassigns themselves and assigns the suggested maintainer in their category.
  - Maintainer reviews take place with any back and forth as necessary and attempts to resolve any open threads.
  - The last maintainer to approve the MR, follows the [Merging a merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html#merging-a-merge-request) guidelines.
  - (Optionally) Change the workflow label of the issue to `workflow::verification`, to indicate all the development work for the issue has been done and it is waiting to be deployed and verified. We will use this label in cases where the work was requested to be verified by product OR we determined we need to perform this verification in production.
1. You are responsible for the issues assigned to you. This means it has to ship with the milestone it's associated with. If you are not able to do this, you have to communicate it early to your manager and other stakeholders (e.g. the product manager, other engineers working on dependent issues). In teams, the team is responsible for this (see [Working in Teams](#working-in-teams)). If you are uncertain, err on the side of overcommunication. It's always better to communicate doubts than to wait.
1. You (and your team, if applicable) are responsible for:
  - Ensuring that your changes [apply cleanly to GitLab Enterprise Edition][ce-ee-docs].
  - The testing of a new feature or fix, especially right after it has been merged and packaged.
  - Creating any [relevant feature or API documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#developers)
  - Shipping secure code, (see [Security is everyone's responsibility](#security-is-everyones-responsibility)).
1. Once a release candidate has been deployed to the staging environment, please verify that your changes work as intended. We have seen issues where bugs did not appear in development but showed in production (e.g. due to CE-EE merge issues).

Be sure to read general guidelines about [issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html) and [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html).

## Working in Teams

For larger issues or issues that contain many different moving parts, you'll be likely working in a team. This team will typically consist of a [backend engineer](/job-families/engineering/backend-engineer/), a [frontend engineer](/job-families/engineering/frontend-engineer/), a [Product Designer](/job-families/product/product-designer/) and a [product manager](/job-families/product/product-manager/).

1. Teams have a shared responsibility to ship the issue in the planned release.
    1. If the team suspects that they might not be able to ship something in time, the team should escalate / inform others as soon as possible. A good start is informing your manager.
    1. It's generally preferable to ship a smaller iteration of an issue, than ship something a release later.
1. Consider starting a Slack channel for a new team, but remember to write all relevant information in the related issue(s). You don't want to have to read up on two threads, rather than only one, and Slack channels are not open to the greater GitLab community.
1. If an issue entails frontend and backend work, consider separating the frontend and backend code into separate MRs and merge them independently under [feature flags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/feature_flags/index.html). This will ensure frontend/backend engineers can work and deliver independently.
    1. It's important to note that even though the code is merged behind a feature flag, it should still be production ready and continue to hold our [definition of done](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/doc/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.md#definition-of-done).
    1. A separate MR containing the integration, documentation (if applicable) and removal of the feature flags should be completed in parallel with the backend and frontend MRs, but should only be merged when both the frontend and backend MRs are on the master branch.

In the spirit of [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration) and [efficiency](/handbook/values/#efficiency-for-the-right-group), members of teams should feel free to discuss issues directly with one another while [being respectful of others' time](/handbook/communication/#be-respectful-of-others-time).

## Convention over Configuration

Avoid adding configuration values in the application settings or in
`gitlab.yml`. Only add configuration if it is absolutely necessary. If you
find yourself adding parameters to tune specific features, stop and consider
how this can be avoided. Are the values really necessary? Could constants be
used that work across the board? Could values be determined automatically?
See [Convention over Configuration](/handbook/product/product-principles/#convention-over-configuration)
for more discussion.

## Choosing Something to Work On

Start working on things with the highest priority in the current milestone. The priority of items are defined under labels in the repository, but you are able to sort by priority.

After sorting by priority, choose something that youâ€™re able to tackle and falls under your responsibility. That means that if youâ€™re a frontend developer, you work on something with the label `frontend`.

To filter very precisely, you could filter all issues for:

- Milestone: Started
- Assignee: None (issue is unassigned)
- Label: Your label of choice. For instance `CI/CD`, `Discussion`, `Quality`, `frontend`, or `Platform`
- Sort by priority

[Use this link to quickly set the above parameters][priority-issues]. You'll still need to filter by the label for your own team.

If youâ€™re in doubt about what to work on, ask your lead. They will be able to tell you.

## Triaging and Reviewing Code from the rest of the Community

It's every [developers' responsibilities] to triage and review code contributed by the rest of the community, and work with them to get it ready for production.

Merge requests from the rest of the community should be labeled with the `Community contribution` label.

When evaluating a merge request from the community, please ensure that a relevant PM is aware of the pending MR by mentioning them.

This should be to be part of your daily routine. For instance, every morning you could triage new merge requests from the rest of the community that are not yet labeled `Community contribution` and either review them or ask a relevant person to review it.

Make sure to follow our [Code Review Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).

## Workflow Labels

Labels are described in our [Contribution guide][contrib-labels-guide] and [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/).

## Working with GitLab.com

GitLab.com is a very large instance of GitLab Enterprise Edition. It runs release candidates for new releases, and sees a lot of issues because of the amount of traffic it gets. There are several internal tools available for developers at GitLab to get data about what's happening in the production system:

### Performance Data

There is extensive [monitoring](https://dashboards.gitlab.com/) publicly available for GitLab.com. For more on this and related tools, see the [monitoring handbook](/handbook/engineering/monitoring/).

### Error Reporting

- [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/) is our error reporting tool
- [log.gprd.gitlab.net](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/) has production logs
- [prometheus.gitlab.com](https://prometheus.gitlab.com/alerts) has alerts for the [production team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#production-team)


## Scheduling Issues

GitLab Inc has to be selective in working on particular issues. We have a limited capacity to work on new things. Therefore, we have to schedule issues carefully.

Product Managers are responsible for scheduling all issues in their respective [product areas](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages), including features, bugs, and tech debt. Product managers alone determine the [prioritization](/handbook/product/product-processes/#how-we-prioritize-work), but others are encouraged to influence the PMs decisions. The UX Lead and Engineering Leads are responsible for allocating people making sure things are done on time. Product Managers are _not_ responsible for these activities, they are not project managers.

Direction issues are the big, prioritized new features for each release. They are limited to a small number per release so that we have plenty of capacity to work on other important issues, bug fixes, etc.

If you want to schedule an issue with the `Seeking community contributions` label, please remove the label first.

Any scheduled issue should have a team label assigned, and at least one type label.

### Requesting Something to be Scheduled

To request scheduling an issue, ask the [responsible product manager](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages)

We have many more requests for great features than we have capacity to work on.
There is a good chance weâ€™ll not be able to work on something.
Make sure the appropriate labels (such as `customer`) are applied so every issue is given the priority it deserves.

## Product Development Timeline

[![](gitlab-release-timelines.png)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/snippets/1731455)

Teams (Product, UX, Development, Quality) continually work on issues according to their respective workflows.
There is no specified process whereby a particular person should be working on a set of issues in a given time period.
However, there are specific deadlines that should inform team workflows and prioritization.
Suppose we are talking about milestone `m` that will be shipped in month `M` (on the 22nd).
We have the following deadlines:

- By month `M-1, 4th` (at least 14 days before milestone `m` begins):
  - Draft of the issues that will be included in the next release (released 22nd of next month).
  - Start capacity and technical discussions with engineering/UX.
  - Assess error budgets to determine feature/reliability balance.
  - Development engineering manager provides product manager with prioritization input for `type::maintenance` issues per [cross-functional prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#cross-functional-prioritization)
  - [Quality](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#cross-functional-prioritization) provides product manager with prioritization input for `type::bug` issues per [cross-functional prioritization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#cross-functional-prioritization)
- By month `M-1, 10th`product manager, taking into consideration prioritization input from development EM, Quality, and UX to create a plan of issues for the upcoming milestone
  - Release scope is finalized. In-scope issues marked with milestone `m`; label `deliverable` applied.
  - Kickoff document is updated with relevant items to be included.
- By month `M-1, 13th` (at least 5 days before milestone `m` begins):
   - Release scope is finalized. In-scope issues marked with milestone `m`; label `deliverable` applied.
   - Kickoff document is updated with relevant items to be included.
- By month `M-1, 16th` (at least 1 day before milestone `m` begins):
  - [Group Kickoffs calls](/handbook/product/product-processes/#kickoff-meetings) recorded and uploaded.
- On month `M-1, 18th` (or next business day, milestone `m` begins): **Kick off!** ðŸ“£
  - [Company Kickoff](#kickoff) call live streamed.
  - Development on milestone `m` begins
- By month `M-1, 24th` The development lead for each stage/section coordinates a stage/section level review with the quad [cross-functional dashboard review process](/handbook/engineering/cross-functional-prioritization/#cross-functional-dashboard-reviews).  After the stages/section level reviews are complete, the VP of Development coordinates a summary review with the CTO, VP of Product, VP of UX, and VP of Quality.
- On `M-1 26th`: GitLab Bot opens [Group Retrospective](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) issue for the current milestone.
- By month `M, 17th`:
  - Completed `m` issues with docs have been merged into master.
  - Feature flags should be flipped from default off to default on after verification to be in the `m` release. See [feature flags](/handbook/product-development-flow/feature-flag-lifecycle/#including-a-feature-behind-feature-flag-in-the-final-release).
  - Merging by the 17th **does not guarantee** that the feature will be in the `m` release. See [release timelines](/handbook/engineering/releases/#timelines).
  - Individual [release post entries](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/index.html#contribution-instructions) merged for all relevant issues.
  - By end of the day, milestone `m` is expired.
- On or around `M, 21st`:
  - [Group Retrospective issues](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) are updated with shipped and missed deliverables and team-members are tagged in the discussion.
- On `M, 19th`, or `M, 20th`, or `M, 21st`:
  - [Milestone Cleanup](#milestone-cleanup) runs on the schedule at [Milestone cleanup schedule](#milestone-cleanup-schedule)
- On month `M, 22nd`: **Release Day** ðŸš€
  - Release shipped to production.
  - Release post published.
- On month `M, 23rd` (the day after the release):
  - The patch release process for milestone `m` starts. This includes regular and security patch releases.
  - All unfinished `m` issues and merge requests are automatically moved to milestone `m+1`, with the exception of `~security` issues.
- On `M, 24th`: Moderator opens the [Retrospective planning and execution issue](#retrospective).
- Between `M, 24th` to `M+1, 3rd`: Assignees of [Group Retrospective issues](#retrospective) summarize the discussion, ensure corrective actions are taken and a DRI is assigned to each. Actions related to participation in [section-based Retrospective Summaries](#retrospective-summary-experiment-in-fy22-q4) are taken.
- On or around `M, 26th`:
  - [Product plans](/handbook/product/product-processes/#managing-your-product-direction) are to update to reflecting previous and current releases, including category epics and direction pages.
- On or around `M, 28th`:
  - Non-critical security patches are  [released](../security/index.html#security-releases).

Refer to [release post content reviews](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#content-reviews) for additional deadlines.

Note that deployments to GitLab.com are more frequent than monthly major/minor releases on the 22nd.
See [auto deploy transition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/blob/21cbd409dd5f157fe252f254f3e897f01908abe2/general/deploy/auto-deploy-transition.md#transition) guidance for details.

## Updating Issues Throughout Development

Team members use labels to track issues throughout development. This gives visibility to other developers, product managers, and designers, so that they can adjust their plans during a monthly iteration. An issue should follow these stages:

- `workflow::in dev`: A developer indicates they are developing an issue by applying the `in dev` label.
- `workflow::in review`: A developer indicates the issue is in code review and UX review by removing the `in dev` label, and applying the `in review` label.
- `workflow::verification`: A developer indicates that all the development work for the issue has been done and is waiting to be deployed and verified.
- `workflow::complete`: A developer indicates the issue has been verified and everything is working by adding the `workflow::complete` label and closing the issue.

## Kickoff

At the beginning of each release, we have a kickoff meeting, publicly livestreamed to YouTube. In the call, the Product Development team (PMs, Product Designers, and Engineers) communicate with the rest of the organization which issues are in scope for the upcoming release. The call is structured by [product area](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages) with each PM leading their part of the call.

The notes are available in a publicly-accessible [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElPkZ90A8ey_iOkTvUs_ByMlwKK6NAB2VOK5835wYK0/edit?usp=sharing). Refer to the doc for details on viewing the livestream.

## Retrospective

The purpose of our retrospective is to help each Product Group, and the entire [R&D cost center](/handbook/finance/financial-planning-and-analysis/#by-cost-center---where-departments-report) at GitLab learn and improve as much as possible from every monthly release.

Each retrospective consist of three parts:

- [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/): retrospectives held by individual [Product Groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups)
- [Retrospective Summary](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#retrospective-summary): a short pre-recorded video which summarizes the learnings across all group retrospectives
- [Retrospective Discussion](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#retrospective-discussion): a 25 minute live discussion diving into retrospective discussion topics

**Timeline**

- `M-1 26th`: GitLab Bot opens [Group Retrospective](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) issue for the current milestone.
- `M, 21st`: Group Retrospectives should be held.
- `M, 24th`: Moderator opens the Retrospective planning and execution issue and communicates a reminder in R&D quad slack channels.
- `M, 24th` to `M+1, 3rd`: Participants complete the Retrospective planning and execution issue, add their notes to the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit#), and suggest and vote on discussion topics.
- `M+1, 4th`: Moderator records the Retrospective Summary video and announces the video and discussion topics.
- `M+1, 6th`: Retrospective Discussion is held.
   - OR, the next Monday if `M+1, 6th` falls in a weekend.
   - OR, the 2nd working day after `M+1, 6th` if `M+1, 6th` is a holiday.

**Moderator**

The moderator of each retrospective is responsible for:

- Coordinating the Retrospective planning and execution issue.
- Presenting the Retrospective Summary.
- Hosting the Retrospective Discussion.

The job of a moderator is to remain objective and is focused on guiding conversations forward. The moderator for each retrospective is assigned by the VP Development in each milestone.

**Retrospective planning and execution issue**

For each monthly release, a Retrospective planning and execution issue ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/8418)) is opened by the moderator to help us coordinate this work.

Create the Retrospective planning and execution issue by selecting the 'product-development-retro' issue template in the ['www-gitlab-com' project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/new#).

Title the issue *<MILESTONE VERSION #> Team Retrospectives*.

Set the due date to 2 days before the Retrospective Discussion to encourage team members to contribute prior to recording of the Retrospective Summary video.

**Retro doc**

The [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit) is a Google Doc we use to collaborate on for our Retrospective Summary and Retrospective Discussion.

### Group Retrospectives

At the end of every release, each team should host their own retrospective. For details on how this is done, see [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).

### Retrospective Summary

Note - we are currently conducting an experiment with [section-based Retrospective Summaries](#retrospective-summary-experiment-in-fy22-q4). During such time we will not be conducting an R&D-wide Retrospective Summary.

The Retrospective Summary is a short pre-recorded video which summarizes the learnings across all [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) ([example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdENBhVOSiw&feature=youtu.be), [example presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kH9TwUAXbslM1cac938hS4Y-3mEBojQlwHw_Mm44kDE/edit?usp=sharing)).

Once all Group Retrospectives are completed, each team inputs their learnings into a single publicly-accessible [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElPkZ90A8ey_iOkTvUs_ByMlwKK6NAB2VOK5835wYK0/edit?usp=sharing). The  moderator then pre-records a video of the highlights. This video is then announced in the Retrospective planning and execution issue along with the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel. In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we also post this video to our public [GitLab Unfiltered channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered/videos).

**Steps for participants**
1. Please host your Group Retrospective following the guidelines outlined in the [handbook](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).
1. After the Group Retrospective is complete, please choose a subset some of your most interesting learnings to share company-wide in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit).  Please try to group by these by our [CREDIT values](/handbook/values/).
1. In the retro doc, if there is a learning that you would like to explicitly highlight, please add the text **highlight** at the beginning of the text. The moderator will highlight this along with other learnings listed in the retro doc when they create the pre-recorded video.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your team from the previous retrospective, please provide an update on them in the retro doc. They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your team in the current retrospective, please add them in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit). They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.
1. Add a checkbox in the table of the Retrospective planning and execution issue when your Group Retrospective is complete and when the retro doc is updated.

**Steps for the moderator**
1. Please read through the Group Retrospective learnings in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit).
1. Add the learnings into a slide deck and identify the highlights you would like to cover.
1. Record a video presentation summarizing the highlights.
1. Upload this video to our public [GitLab Unfiltered channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered/videos).
1. Announce the video and discussion topics in Retrospective planning and execution issue, the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel, and the retro doc.

### Retrospective Discussion

The Retrospective Discussion is a 25 minute live discussion among participants where we deep dive into discussion topics from our Group Retrospectives ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP9E7RbNSPw)). In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we livestream this meeting to YouTube and monitor chat for questions from viewers. Please check the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit?usp=sharing) for details on joining the livestream.

**Discussion Topics**

For each retrospective discussion, we aim to host an interactive discussion covering two discussion topics. We limit this to two topics due to the length of the meeting.

The discussion topics stem from our Group Retrospective learnings and should be applicable to the majority of participants.

Discussion topics are suggested by participants by commenting on the Retrospective planning and execution issue. Participants can vote on these topics by adding a :thumbsup: reaction. The two topics with the most :thumbsup: votes will be used as the discussion topics. If there are not enough votes or if the discussion topics are not relevant to the majority of participants, the moderator can choose other discussion topics.

**Meeting Agenda**

* Improvement tasks from the previous release (5 minutes)
* Discussion topics (14 minutes, 2 topics at 7 minutes each)
* Improvement tasks from the current release (5 minutes)
* Wrap up (1 minute)

**Steps for participants**

1. Suggest discussion topics by commenting on to the Retrospective planning and execution issue.
1. Vote on discussion topics by adding a :thumbsup: reaction. Voting closes on `M+1, 3rd`.
1. Once discussion topics are announced on `M+1, 4th`, begin adding your comments to the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit).
1. During the Retrospective Discussion, be prepared to verbalize any improvement tasks or commentary on the discussion topics. If you can't make the meeting and there is an item for you to verbalize, please ask someone else on your team to attend to do so.

**Steps for the moderator**

1. In the Retrospective planning and execution issue, create a thread asking participants to suggest and vote on topics.
1. Voting ends at the close of business on `M+1, 3rd`. Take note of which discussion topics have the most votes at this time. If there are not enough votes or if you deem the discussion topics as not relevant to the majority of participants, please choose other discussion topics.
1. Announce the discussion topics alongside of the Retrospective Summary video in the Retrospective planning and execution issue, the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel, and the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEkM_7Dj4bT21GJy0Ut3By76FZqCfLBmFQNVThmW2TY/edit)
1. Ensure the Retrospective Discussion calendar invite is sent to participants by coordinating with the VP Development.
1. Host the Retrospective Discussion and press livestream to Youtube.
1. After the Retrospective Discussion, close the Retrospective planning and execution issue.

### Utilizing Internal Notes in Retrospective Issues

Monthly retrospectives are usually performed in a confidential issue made public upon close. Content of these issues while public aligns with [GitLab SAFE Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/safe-framework/). 

Where unSAFE information must be discussed in a retrospective, [Internal Notes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#add-an-internal-note) should be utilized in order to adhere to SAFE Guidelines. Internal notes remain confidential to participants of the retrospective even after the issue is made public, including Guest users of the parent group.

Examples of information that should remain Confidential per SAFE guidelines are any company confidential information that is not public, or any data that reveals information not generally known or not available externally which may be considered sensitive information. Specific examples of information that should be carefully submitted to the retrospective include impact on revenue, information relating to the security of the platform, or specific customer data.

### Triaging retrospective improvements

At the end of each retrospective the [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/#engineering-productivity-structure) is responsible for triaging improvement items identified from the retrospective.
This is needed for a single owner to be aware of the bigger picture technical debt and backstage work. The actual work can be assigned out to other teams or engineers to execute.

### Retrospective Summary Moderators for FY22

The Moderator for the Retrospective Summary is chosen on a quarterly basis.  For FY22 we have selected 4 moderators from across Engineering and Product.  The moderators are:

- Q1: [Sam Goldstein](/company/team/#sgoldstein)
- Q2: [Tanya Pazitny](/company/team/#tpazitny)
- Q3: [Kenny Johnston](/company/team/#kencjohnston)
- Q4: [Section Based Retro Experiment](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#retrospective-summary-experiment-in-fy22-q4)

## Retrospective Summary Experiment in FY22 Q4

During FY22 Q4 (the 14.4, 14.5, 14.6 Retrospectives) we will conduct an experiment where we perform retrospective summaries at the Section level instead of an R&D-wide retrospective summary. Section level leaders in Product and Development are the DRIs for retrofitting the current retrospective summary process for their section and documenting their process for doing so.

### Experiment Hypothesis

As GitLab has grown, there have become too many layers between a group retrospective and the company-wide retrospective. Performing retrospective summaries at the Section level will increase our rate of learning and encourage broader collaboration between stable counterparts across the R&D organization.

### Experiment Success Measurements

We'll consider this experiment a success if:
- All team member cumulative engagement, as measured by issue and agenda doc comments, in all section Retrospective Summary discussions is higher than the current baseline (14.1,14.2,14.3)
- Stable counterpart engagement, as measured by issue and agenda doc comments, in section Retrospective Summary discussions include team members from an average of more than 4 functions (Security, UX, Quality)
- The effort to prepare and perform a retrospective summary is deemed by DRIs to be < 4 hours per month

### Experiment Section DRIs

While leaders are available in the [categories page](/handbook/product/categories/) (and subject to change) - we explicitly call out the DRIs for each section in this experiment.

- Dev - Tim Zallman and David Desanto
- Sec - Todd Stadelhofer and Hillary Benson
- Ops - Sam Goldstein and Kenny Johnston
- Enablement - Chun Du and Josh Lambert
- Growth - Wayne Haber and Hila Qu
- Fulfillment - Wayne Haber and Justin Farris
- AI Assisted and Anti-Abuse - Wayne Haber and Taylor McCaslin

### Conducting a Section Retrospective
Discretion is provided to Section leaders on how to conduct a section retrospective discussion. A good starting point would be to follow the current [handbook](#retrospective-summary) and [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/product-development-retro.md) recommendations for our R&D wide retrospective. Consider creating section versions of the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/product-development-retro.md) and [discussion doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElPkZ90A8ey_iOkTvUs_ByMlwKK6NAB2VOK5835wYK0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Milestone Cleanup

Engineering Managers are responsible for capacity planning and scheduling for their respective teams with guidance from their counterpart Product Managers.

To ensure hygiene across Engineering, we run scheduled pipelines to move
unfinished work (open issues and merge requests) with the expired milestone to
the next milestone, and label `~"missed:x.y"` for the expired milestone.
Additionally, label `~"missed-deliverable"` whenever `~"Deliverable"` is
presented.

This is currently implemented as part of our [automated triage operations](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/policies/move-milestone-forward.yml). Additionally, issues with the `~Deliverable` label which have a milestone beyond current +1, will have the `~Deliverable` label removed.

We keep the milestone open for 3 months after it's expired, based on the [release and maintenance policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html).

The milestone cleanup is currently applied to the [following groups and projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/blob/master/.gitlab/ci/missed-resources.yml):
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/10515/edit)
* [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/29681/edit)
* [GitLab Gitaly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/29054/edit)
* [GitLab charts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/39481/edit)
* [GitLab QA](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-qa), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/29050/edit)
* [Omnibus GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab), [schedule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/triage-ops/pipeline_schedules/31880/edit) (only moving milestone for now, not labelling)

Milestones closure is in the remit of [the Delivery team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/delivery/). At any point in time a release might need to be created for an active milestone,and once that is no longer the case, the Delivery team closes the milestone.

### Milestone cleanup schedule

The milestone cleanup will happen one weekday before the 22nd (release day).

The following is observed to account for the weekends:
- If the 22nd falls on the weekend, cleanup happens on the prior friday.
- If the 22nd falls on Monday, cleanup happens on the prior friday.

These actions will be applied to open issues:
- Open issues and merge requests will be moved to the next milestone, and
  labelled with `~"missed:x.y"`.
- `~"missed-deliverable"` will also be added whenever `~"Deliverable"`
    is presented.

Milestones are closed when the Delivery team no longer needs to create a backport release for a specific milestone.

## Kickoff and Retrospective Public Stream Instructions

Both the monthly kickoff and retrospective meetings are publicly streamed to the [GitLab Unfiltered YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A?view_as=subscriber). The [EBA](/job-families/people-group/executive-business-administrator/) for Engineering is the [moderator](/handbook/group-conversations/#moderator) and responsible for initiating the Public Stream or designating another moderator if EBA is unable to attend.


## Use Group Labels and Group Milestones

When working in GitLab (and in particular, the GitLab.org group), use group labels and group milestones as much as you can. It is easier to plan issues and merge requests at the group level, and exposes ideas across projects more naturally. If you have a project label, you can promote it to a group milestone. This will merge all project labels with the same name into the one group label. The same is true for promoting group milestones.

## Technical debt

We definitely don't want our technical debt to grow faster than our code base. To prevent this from happening we should consider not only the impact of the technical debt but also a contagion. How big and how fast is this problem going to be over time? Is it likely a bad piece of code will be copy-pasted for a future feature? In the end, the amount of resources available is always less than amount of technical debt to address.

To help with prioritization and decision-making process here, we recommend thinking about contagion as an interest rate of the technical debt. There is [a great comment](http://disq.us/p/1ros2o9) from the internet about it:

> You wouldn't pay off your $50k student loan before first paying off your $5k credit card and it's because of the high interest rate. The best debt to pay off first is one that has the highest loan payment to recurring payment reduction ratio, i.e. the one that reduces your overall debt payments the most, and that is usually the loan with the highest interest rate.

Technical debt is prioritized like [other technical decisions](/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#prioritizing-technical-decisions) in [product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) by [product management](/handbook/product/product-processes/#how-we-prioritize-work).

For technical debt which might span, or fall in gaps between groups they should be brought up for a [globally optimzed](/handbook/values/#global-optimization) prioritization in [retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) or directly with the appropriate member of the [Product Leadership team](/handbook/product/product-leadership/). Additional avenues for addressing technical debt outside of product groups are [Rapid Action issues](/handbook/engineering/development/#rapid-action-issue) and [working groups](/company/team/structure/working-groups/).

## UX debt

Sometimes there is an intentional decision to deviate from the agreed-upon [MVC](/handbook/product/product-principles/#the-minimal-viable-change-mvc), which sacrifices the user experience. When this occurs, the Product Designer creates a follow-up issue and labels it `UX debt` to address the UX gap in subsequent releases.

For the same reasons as technical debt, we don't want UX debt to grow faster than our code base.

These issues are prioritized like [other technical decisions](/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#prioritizing-technical-decisions) in [product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) by [product management](/handbook/product/product-processes/#how-we-prioritize-work). You can see the number of UX debt issues on the [UX Debt dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/641753/UX-Debt).

As with [technical debt](#technical-debt), UX debt should be brought up for [globally optimized](/handbook/values/#global-optimization) prioritization in [retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) or directly with the appropriate member of the [Product Leadership team](/handbook/product/product-leadership/).

## UI polish

UI polish issues are visual improvements to the existing user interface, touching mainly aesthetic aspects of the UI that are guided by [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/) foundations. UI polish issues generally capture improvements related to color, typography, iconography, and spacing. We apply the `UI polish` label to these issues. UI polish issues don't introduce functionality or behavior changes to a feature.

### Examples of UI polish

- **Aesthetic improvements** ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/290262)): removing unnecessary borders from a UI, updating the background color of an element, fixing the font size of a heading element.
- **Misalignment of text, buttons, etc** ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/280538)): although because many times something isn't broken, these improvements are considered UI polish. These could also be considered a bug.
- **Incorrect spacing between UI elements** ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7905)): when two interface elements are using inconsistent spacing values, such as 10px instead of 8px. It could also be considered technical debt. Note that if two interface elements have zero space between them, its an obvious bug.
- **Visual inconsistencies across different product areas** ([example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/296948)): visual inconsistencies could occur when we have have a series of buttons on a particular view. For example, when 3/4 of them have been migrated to use the Pajamas component, and 1/4 of them are still using a deprecated button, resulting in a visual inconsistency. This is considered a UI polish.

### What is not UI polish

- **Functional inconsistency related to the experience**: for example, using a manual action to add an assignee automatically shows the assignee in the sidebar but using a manual action to add a weight to an issue does not automatically show the weight in the sidebar. This is not currently considered UI polish. It would be considered a UX issue.
- **Improving visibility of system status**: status indicator improvements are experience improvements and are not classified as UI polish.
  - Even when updating something that is purely visual, such as a status icon, to improve the meaning the user has of what they are viewing, we are trying to improve the experience of that user.

## Monitor Merge Request Trends

Open merge requests sometimes become idle (not updated by a human in more than a month). Once a month, engineering managers will receive an [`Merge requests requiring attention triage issue`](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#group-level-merge-requests-that-may-need-attention) that includes all (non-WIP/Draft) MRs for their group and use it to determine if any action should be taken (such as nudging the author/reviewer/maintainer). This assists in getting merge requests merged in a reasonable amount of time which we track with the [Open MR Review Time (OMRT)](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#open-mr-review-time-omrt) and [Open MR Age (OMA)](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#open-mr-age-oma) performance indicators.

Open merge requests may also have other properties that indicate that the engineering manager should research them and potentially take action to improve efficiency. One key property is the number of threads, which, when high, may indicate a need to update the plan for the MR or that a synchronous discussion should be considered. Another property is the number of pipelines, which, when high, may indicate a need to revisit the plan for the MR. These metrics are not yet included in an automatically created a triage issue. However, they are available in a [Sisense dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/663398/Merge-requests-that-may-warrant-attention). Engineering managers are encouraged to check this dashboard for their group periodically (once or twice a month) in the interim.

## Security is everyone's responsibility

[Security](/security/) is our top priority. Our Security Team is raising the bar on security every day to protect users' data and make GitLab a safe place for everyone to contribute. There are many lines of code, and Security Teams need to scale. That means shifting security left in the [Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC)](/stages-devops-lifecycle/). Each team has an [Application Security Stable Counterpart](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/stable-counterparts.html) who can help you, and you can find more secure development help in the `#sec-appsec` Slack channel.

Being able to start the security review process earlier in the software development lifecycle means we will catch vulnerabilities earlier, and mitigate identified vulnerabilities before the code is merged. You should know when and how to proactively [seek an Application Security Review](/handbook/security/security-engineering/application-security/appsec-reviews.html). You should also be familiar with our [Secure Coding Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/secure_coding_guidelines.html).

We are fixing the obvious security issues before every merge, and therefore, scaling the security review process. Our workflow includes a check and validation by the reviewers of every merge request, thereby enabling developers to act on identified vulnerabilities before merging. As part of that process, developers are also encouraged to reach out to the Security Team to discuss the issue at that stage, rather than later on, when mitigating vulnerabilities becomes more expensive. After all, security is everyone's job. See also our [Security Paradigm](/direction/secure/#security-paradigm)

## Rapid Engineering Response

From time to time, there are occasions that engineering team must act quickly in response to urgent issues. This section describes how the engineering team handles certain kinds of such issues.

### Scope

Not everything is urgent. See below for a non-exclusive list of things that are in-scope and not in-scope. As always, use your experience and judgment, and communicate with others.

* In Scope
  * Last-minute release blocking bug or security patch before an imminent release.
  * High severity (severity::1/priority::1) security issues. Refer to [security severity and priority](/handbook/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues).
  * Highest priority and severity customer issues based on the [priority and severity definitions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/doc/development/contributing/issue_workflow.md#priority-labels).
* Not In Scope
  * An operational issue of GitLab.com or a self managed customer environment. This falls under the [on-call](/handbook/on-call/index.html) process.
  * Self developed and maintained tools that are not officially supported products by GitLab.
  * Feature request by a specific customer.

### Process

1. Person requesting Rapid Engineering Response creates an issue supplying all known information and applies [priority and severity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/doc/development/contributing/issue_workflow.md#priority-labels) (or [security severity and priority](/handbook/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues)) to the best of their ability.
1. Person requesting Rapid Engineering Response raises the issue to their own manager and the [subject matter domain](/handbook/product/categories/index.html) engineering manager (or the delegation if OOO).
   1. In case a specific group cannot be determined, raise the issue to the Director of Engineering (or the delegation if OOO) of the [section](/handbook/product/categories/index.html).
   1. In case a specific section cannot be determined, raise the issue to the Sr. Director of Development (or the delegation if OOO).
1. The engineering sponsor (subject matter Manager, Director, and/or Sr. Director) invokes all stakeholders of the subject matter as a rapid response task force to determine the best route of resolution:
   1. Engineering manager(s)
   1. Product Management
   1. QE
   1. UX
   1. Docs
   1. Security
   1. Support
   1. Distribution engineering manager
   1. Delivery engineering manager (Release Management)
1. Adjust [priority and severity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/doc/development/contributing/issue_workflow.md#priority-labels) or [security severity and priority](/handbook/security/#severity-and-priority-labels-on-security-issues) if necessary, and work collaboratively on the determined resolution.

## Performance Refinement

A bi-weekly performance refinement session is held by the Development and QE teams jointly to raise awareness and foster wider collaboration about high-impact performance issues.
A high impact issue has a direct measurable impact on GitLab.com [service levels or error budgets](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/library/service-levels-error-budgets/).

### Scope

The [Performance Refinement issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1233204) is reviewed in this refinement exercise.

### Process

1. To participate in the bi-weekly refinement, ask your engineering director to forward the invite of the *Performance Refinement* meeting which is at 15:00 UTC every other Thursday. Here is the [meeting agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icG6yrW2oebXz8iXvgfM5JjtMqpsDBCn1v3_VO2ghS0/edit#).
1. To nominate issues to the board:
   1. Assign [a performance severity](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity) on the issue to help asses the priority assignment for the refinement session.
   1. Ensure that the issue clearly explains the problem, the (potential) impact on GitLab.com's availability, and ideally, clearly defines a proposed solution to the problem.
   1. Use the label `bug::performance`.
1. For the issues under the **Open** column:
   1. An engineering manager will be assigned if either the `Milestone` or the label `workflow::ready for development` is missing.
   1. Engineering manager brings assigned issue(s) to the Product Manager for prioritization and planning.
   1. Engineering manager unassigns themselves once the issue is planned for an iteration, i.e. associated with a `Milestone` and the label `workflow::ready for development`.
1. To highlight high-impact issues which need additional discussion, please add an agenda item.
1. If a guest attendee would be helpful for collaboration, please forward the invite. For example, a CSM or Support Engineer may have information that would be helpful for an upcoming topic.

## Infradev

The infradev process is established to identify Issues requiring priority attention in support of SaaS availability and reliability. These escalations are intended to primarily be asyncronous as timely triage and attention is required. In addition to primary management through the Issues, any gaps, concerns, or critical triage is handled in the weekly [GitLab SaaS Infrastructure](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#gitlab-saas-infrastructure) meeting.

### Scope

The [infradev issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1193197?label_name[]=infradev) is the primary focus of this process.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Infrastructure

1. Nominate issues by adding `Infradev` label.
+1. Assess [Severity](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity-slos) and `Priority` and apply the corresponding label as appropriate.
1. Provide [as much information as possible](#a-guide-to-creating-effective-infradev-issues) to assist development engineering troubleshooting.

#### Development

1. Development directors are responsible for [triaging Infradev issues](/handbook/engineering/development/#daily-duties-for-engineering-directors) regularly by following the [triage process](#triage-process) below.
1. Development managers are encouraged to [triage issues](#triage-process) regularly as well.
1. Development managers collaborate with their counterpart Product Managers to refine, schedule, and resolve Infradev issues.
1. Usually, issues are nominated as Infradev issues by SREs or Managers in the Infrastructure Department. Development engineers/managers are not expected to nominate Infradev issues.
   1. However, when it's necessary to spin off new issues from an existing Infradev issue, development engineers and managers may also apply `Infradev` label to the new issues.
   1. When development engineers and managers split off new Infradev issues, they must have a `Severity` and `Priority` labels to the new issues.  The labels should correspond to the importance of the follow-on work.

#### Product Management

1. Product Managers perform holistic prioritization of both product roadmap and Infradev issues as one unified backlog.
1. Product Managers collaborate with their counterpart Development Managers to refine, schedule, and resolve Infradev issues.

### Triage Process

(To be completed primarily by Development Engineering Management)

Issues are nominated to the board through the inclusion of the label `infradev` and will appear on the [infradev board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/1193197?label_name[]=infradev).

1. Review issues in the Open column. Look for issues within your Stage/Group/Category, but also for those which lack a clear assignment or where the assignment may need correction.
1. Review the [severity](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#severity) on the issue to validate appropriate prioritization.
1. Ensure that the issue clearly explains the problem, the (potential) impact on GitLab.com's availability, and ideally, clearly defines a proposed solution to the problem.
1. Assign a Development Manager and a Product Manager to any issue where the `Milestone` or the label `workflow::ready for development` is missing.
   1. Development Manager and Product Manager collaborate on the assigned issue(s) for prioritization and planning.
   1. Development Manager and Product Manager unassign themselves once the issue is planned for an iteration, i.e. associated with a `Milestone` and the label `workflow::ready for development`.
1. All Issues should be prioritized into the appropriate workflow stage. It is the intent to maintain no Open (un-triaged) items.

Issues with `~infradev ~severity::1 ~priority::1 ~production request` labels applied require immediate resolution.

`~infradev` issues requiring a ~"breaking change" should not exist.  If a current `~infradev` issue requires a breaking change then it should split into two issues.  The first issue should be the immediate `~infradev` work that can be done under current SLOs.  The second issue should be  ~"breaking change" work that needs to be completed at the next major release in accordance with [handbook guidance](/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#breaking-changes-deprecations-and-removing-features). Agreement from development DRI as well as the infrastructure DRI should be documented on the issue.

Additionally, an automated status report is generated in the [gitlab-org/infradev-reports](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/infradev-reports/-/issues) issue tracker. A new report is opened weekly, and updated regularly. The report categorizes each infradev issue according to several criteria, and can help with the triage and priorization process.

### A Guide to Creating Effective Infradev Issues

Triage of infradev Issues is desired to occur asynchronously. There is also a section of the [Weekly GitLab SaaS meeting](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/#gitlab-saas-infrastructure) which aims to address anything requiring synchronous discussion or which hasn't been triaged. This meeting has time constraints and many of the participants may not have a detailed understanding of the problems being presented. For maximum efficiency, please ensure the following, so that your infradev issues can gain maximum traction.

1. **Use the [InfraDev issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=InfraDev) to create the issue on the gitlab-org/gitlab issue tracker.**
1. **Clearly state the scope of the problem, and how it affects GitLab.com**. Examples could include:
   1. Reliability issues: the problem could cause a widespread outage or degradation on GitLab.com. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244865)
   1. Saturation issues: the problem could leave to increased saturation, latency issues due to resource over-utilization. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/2458)
   1. Service-level degradation: the problem is causing our service-level monitoring to degrade, impacting the overall SLA of GitLab.com and potentially leaving to SLA violations. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292732)
   1. Unnecessary alerts: the problem does not have a major impact on users, but is leading to extraneous alerts, impacting the ability of SREs to effectively triage incidents due to alerting noise. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/292732)
   1. Problems which extend the time to diagnosis of incidents: for example, issues which degrade the observability of GitLab.com, swallow user-impacting errors or logs, etc. These could lead to incidents taking much longer to clear, and impacting availability. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/-/issues/10933#note_464394760)
   1. Deficiencies in our public APIs which lead to customers compensating by generating substantially more traffic to get the required results. [example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/232887)
1. **Quantify the effect of the problem** to help ensure that correct prioritization occurs.
   1. Include costs to availability. The [Incident Budget Explorer](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/general-incident-budget-explorer/general-incident-budget-explorer?orgId=1) dashboard can help here.
   1. Include the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.
   1. Include screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.
   1. **Always include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further**.
1. **Provide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem**. Do not add the `infradev` label to architectural problems, vague solutions, or requests to investigate an unknown root-cause.
1. **Ensure scope is limited**. Each issue should be able to be owned by a single stage group team and should not need to be broken down further. Single task solutions are best.
1. **Ensure a realistic severity is applied**: review the [availability severity label guidelines](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#availability) and ensure that applied severity matches. Always ensure all issues have a severity, even if you are unsure.
1. **If possible, include ownership labels** for more effective triage. The [product categories](/handbook/product/categories/) can help determine the appropriate stage group to assign the issue to.
1. **Cross-reference links to Production Incidents, Pagerduty Alerts, Slack Alerts and Slack Discussions**. To help ensure that the team performing the triage have all the available data.
   1. By adding "Related" links on the infradev issue, the [Infradev Status Report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/infradev-reports/-/issues) will display a count of the number of production incidents related to each infradev issue, for easier and clearer prioritization.
1. **Ensure that the issue title is accurate, brief and clear**. Change the title over time if you need to keep it accurate.
1. **By adding an infradev label to an issue, you are assuming responsibility and becoming the sponsor/champion of the issue**.
1. **Provide a method for validating that the original issue still exists**
   1. Sometimes infradev issues will resolve on their own, or are resolved as a side-effect of an unrelated change.
   1. In the infradev issue description, provide a clear way of checking whether the problem still exists.
   1. Having a way of checking validity can save on a great deal of back-and-forth discussion between Infradev Triage participants including Engineering Managers, Directors and Product Managers and make space for other non-resolved issues to get scheduled sooner.
   1. Ideally, provide a link to a Thanos query or an ELK query and clear instructions on how to interpret the results to determine whether the problem is still occurring. [Check the "Verfication" section in this issue as an example of this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/3670#verification).
   1. Alternatively, provide clear instructions on how to recreate or validate the problem.
   1. If an issue has been resolved, use the following process:
      1. Reassign the issue back to the author, or an appropriate owner, requesting that they confirm the resolution, and close the issue  if they concur. If not, they should follow up with a note and unassign themselves.
