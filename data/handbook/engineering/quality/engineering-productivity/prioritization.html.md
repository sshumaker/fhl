## Prioritization of planned work

The Engineering Productivity team has diverse responsibilities and reactive work. Work is categorized as planned and reactive.

### Guiding principles

- We focus on OKRs, corrective actions and preventative work.
- We adhere to the general release milestones like %x.y.
- We are ambitious with our targeted planned work per milestone. These targets are not reflective of a commitment. Reactive work load will ebb and flow and we do not expected to accomplish everything planned for the current milestone.
- [Priority labels](/handbook/engineering/quality/issue-triage/#priority) are used to indicate relative priority for a milestone.

### Weighting

We follow the [department weighting guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/#weights) to relatively weight issues over time to understand a milestone velocity and increase predictability. 

When weighting, think about knowns and complexity related to recently completed work. The goal with weighting is to allow for some estimation ambiguity that allows for a consistent predictable flow of work each milestone. 

### Prioritization activities

| When | Activity | DRI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | Assign `~priority::1`, `~priority::2` issues to a milestone | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
| Weekly | Weight issues identified with `~"needs weight"` | Engineering Productivity Backend Engineer |
| Weekly | Prioritize all `~"Engineering Productivity"` issues | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
| 2 weeks prior to milestone start | Milestone planned work is identified and scheduled | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
| 2 weeks prior to milestone start | Provide feedback on planned work | Engineering Productivity team |
| 1 week prior to milestone start | Transition any work that is not in progress for current milestone to upcoming milestone | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
| 1 week prior to milestone start | Adjust planned work for upcoming milestone | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
| 1 week prior to milestone start | Final adjustments to planned scope | Engineering Productivity team |
| During milestone | Adjust priorities and scope based on newly identified issues and reactive workload | Engineering Productivity Engineering Manager |
