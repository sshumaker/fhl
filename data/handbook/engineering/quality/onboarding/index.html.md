### Engagement Quadrant

The engagement Quadrant is designed to help you and your direct report evaluate how they currently feel about their work.
This is not intended to be a performance evaluation tool, but rather a self-introspective mechanism to help frame the conversation.

![engagement-quadrant.png](engagement-quadrant.png)

* **Low knowledge & High excitement**: When we are excited on starting something new but unaware of all the things needed to succeed (unknown unknowns).
* **Low knowledge & Low excitement**: As time progresses if we haven't made progress on acquiring knowledge (sustained unknown unknowns), the excitement is also lowered. We need to expedite on attaining additional help to unblock.
* **High knowledge & High excitement**: We have made progress on learning what is needed to be productive/proficient while feeling engaged and excited. This is the optimal state.
* **High knowledge & Low excitement**: When we are already proficient at the current task but it may not be as challenging. We should have a discussion to identify the next area of interest.

When starting something new, the goal is to discover unknowns and learn them quickly so you can move into the `High knowledge & High excitement` state as fast as possible. Then keep iterating/improving so that you are still challenged and stay there.
