## Self-Managed Environment Triage

There is a bi-weekly self-managed environment triage meeting involving various
team members from the Enablement section, Support, Customer Success, and
Technical Writing, which focuses on the following:
* Triaging customers and prospects that are setting up new environments or migrating existing environments in line with our reference architectures.
* Additions to or refinements of the reference architecture specs and documentation.

For more information, please see the [Self-Managed Environment Triage board] and
the [Self-Managed Environment Triage agenda] (internal only). To be added to the
meetings, please reach out to the Quality Engineering Manager, Enablement.

## Quality process across groups

Overall we follow the same process as [defined](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/quality-engineering/#how-we-work) in our Quality handbook across all groups in Enablement
except for a few exceptions curated to fit the needs of specific groups.
