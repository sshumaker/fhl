## Overview

This page describes the bug prioritization process performed by the quality engineering sub-department as part of the cross-functional prioritization process.

An overview of the full process can be found on the [cross-functional prioritization](/handbook/product/cross-functional-prioritization/) handbook page.

## Timeline

As defined in our [Product Development Timeline](/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline), there are specific deadlines for prioritization. Given a milestone `m` that will be shipped in month `M` (on the 22nd):

- By month `M-1, 4th` (at least 14 days before milestone `m` begins), SETs provide a list of prioritized `type::bug` issues to the product managers of their counterpart groups. If a counterpart group does not have an assigned SET, this list will be provided by the respective QEM.
- Between `M-1, 4th` and `M-1, 10th`, the quad for each counterpart group (PMs, EMs, UX, and Quality) discusses which issues to include in the upcoming milestone.
- By month `M-1, 10th`, the product manager, taking into consideration prioritization input from the quad, creates a plan of issues for the upcoming milestone.

## Process

SETs can use the [bug prioritization dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/1037965/Bug-Prioritization) to put together a suggested list of bugs for their counterpart groups.
This dashboard should be revisited for each milestone, as the data will change over time.

As a general guideline, the total amount of bugs proposed should match the burndown plan from the dashboard for your specific group. 
This total can be found under **Total Bugs** in the chart titled **Milestone planning (bug counts to schedule)**.

It is also helpful to include the **Total Bug %** as well, which can be found in the **Milestone planning (bug % of scheduled issues)** chart.
This metric can help groups aim toward scheduling the appropriate percentage of bugs if they do not have the capacity to work on every bug listed.

SETs / QEMs can include this list as part of their group's milestone planning issue. The [bug prioritization issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/QA%20Bug%20Prioritization.md) can also be used as a guide for organizing a bug prioritization section in the planning issue, or for creating a new issue for groups that do not have a planning issue.

List of group planning issues used by various product groups to plan monthly releases:

This process is not intended to be one-size-fits-all, and groups are encouraged to find what best works for the team.

### Dashboard Walkthrough

This table includes a list of the charts that can be found on the bug prioritization dashboard and a description of what each one represents. 

The [bug prioritization dashboard walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3NjPV6zkk) video also offers an overview of the dashboard with examples.

| Milestone planning (bug counts to schedule)     | This chart helps determine the number of bugs needed to be pulled into the milestone in order to meet the selected burndown plan. <br/><br/> The "Open Bugs (Total)" column uses the same data from the "Open bugs by severity" chart. <br/><br/> The "Burndown Bugs" column shows how many bugs must be pulled in per milestone, by severity, in order to start reducing the backlog. <br/><br/>  The "New Bugs" column approximates how many new bugs of each severity we can expect to have open in a given milestone. The total number of new bugs here is the minimum needed to be scheduled to not grow the backlog.  |
| Milestone planning (bug % of scheduled issues)  | This chart represents the same concept as the Milestone planning (bug counts) chart, but in percentages of the total number of MRs merged over time. <br/><br/> The "New Bug %" column is the percentage of bugs needed to be taken up in the upcoming milestone in order to not grow the backlog, without burndown. <br/><br/> The "Total Bug %" column is the percentage of bugs needed to be taken up in the upcoming milestone in order to burn down the backlog.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Open bugs over time                             | This graph visualizes the number of bugs opened over time by severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| S2 Bug Backlog Over Time                        | This graph visualizes the number of open S2 bugs in the backlog over time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Open bugs (with severity label)                 | Lists open bugs with links to their respective issues, sorted by severity in descending order (`severity::1` - `severity::4`). Each severity group is then sorted by bug age, from oldest to newest. <br/><br/> SETs / QEMs can use this list to put together a suggested list of bugs for their counterpart groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Prioritization Guidelines

The following considerations can be helpful to keep in mind when determining which bugs to prioritize.

- Age (older vs. newer)
- Severity (higher vs. lower)
- Past due bugs (bugs that slipped from previous milestones, missed SLOs, etc.)
- Customer reported vs. internal (issues tagged with `customer`)
- Popularity/number of users impacted
  - This will require some investigation and discussion among the quad, but there a few indicators that can help us get started:
    - Number of upvotes on an issue
    - Context from comments or customer support mentioning the number of users impacted
    - [Kibana](https://log.gprd.gitlab.net/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.gitlab.net/gitlab/gitlabcom/) prod logs for tracking how many users are experiencing specific errors
    - Some product groups have dashboards and other tools to track [xMAU (monthly active usage)](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/xmau-analysis/) for their features. This can help us gauge how impactful a bug may be if it is affecting a feature with high usage.
- Not actively being worked on
- Not already assigned to a future milestone (unless it requires escalation)
- Not currently blocked
- Aligns with the group's current feature work and roadmap (ex: it may be more efficient to fix bugs relating to `feature A` together,
  while `feature A` is being updated in a future milestone)

We should also aim to align our decisions with the below [product prioritization framework](/handbook/product/product-processes/#prioritization)
