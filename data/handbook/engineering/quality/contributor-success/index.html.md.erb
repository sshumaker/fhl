## Strategy

This team directly follows the strategy outlined in our [open source growth strategy](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html).

## Mission

The goal of the team is to increase the technical improvements and efficiency of our contribution process to sustain our
ambition of [1000+ contributors with merged MRs per month to GitLab](/company/strategy/#2-build-on-our-open-core-strength).

### FY23 Direction

Note: FY24 Direction will come up shortly

In FY23 we will be focused on growing the number of unique new monthly contributors, reducing [Open Community MR Age
(OCMA)](#open-community-mr-age-ocma) and increasing [MRARR](#mrarr). This will increase development velocity without
requiring additional engineering resources.

Parallel to this we'll increase 
[observability of community contributed value](#community-contributed-value-observability) through improving the 
business intelligence around it. This will allow us to create some predictability through 
[foreshadowing](#community-metrics-foreshadowing). These efforts are cross-functional and require working together 
with Marketing and Product Development.
This accounts for 70 - 80% of the workload. The remaining 20 - 30% is ad-hoc work. The ad-hoc work is eclectic and
ranges from supporting customers on contributions, supporting various open source initiatives and supporting the
[Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/).

#### Unique New Monthly Contributors

1. Minimize reliance on human interaction
1. Reduce volatility through introducing [automations](#community-merge-request-workflow-automations) that drive contributions
   forward automatically
1. Capitalize on untapped potential - MRs that have become stale but have received a seal of approval as useful addition to GitLab.
1. Invest into attracting more new contributors

#### Community Contributed Value Observability

1. Introduce measurement points in various places in the contribution pipeline
1. [Collect objective and subjective feedback from contributors about the process](/handbook/engineering/quality/triage-operations/#code-review-experience-feedback)
1. Create insight into actual community contribution pipeline size
1. Standardize contribution MRARR valuation
1. Categorize contribution and measure value per type

#### Community Metrics Foreshadowing

1. Predict community metric trends
1. Empower teams to react to negative trends before they actualize
1. Define ambitious targets for FY24

#### Open Community MR Age (OCMA)

1. Minimize reliance on human factors that contribute to a large standard deviation
1. Identify & drive tooling improvements to decrease OCMA, and collaborate with the [Engineering Productivity team](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/) 
through shared tooling for [automated triaging](/handbook/engineering/quality/engineering-productivity/#automated-triage-policies)

#### Leading Organizations

The GitLab [Leading Organizations program](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/leading-organizations/) is a
cross-functional initiative that is led by the [Contributor Success team](/handbook/engineering/quality/contributor-success/) 
and [Community Relations team](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/). 

The Leading Organization program supports GitLab's [mission](/company/mission/#mission) by recognizing and incentivizing
organizations who are among our most active contributors. A company or individual
[qualifies](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/leading-organizations/#qualification) for unique benefits by
reaching 20 merged merge requests or more over a trailing three full calendar month basis.

See our workflows on [how to add or remove an organization](/handbook/engineering/quality/contributor-success/community-contributors-workflows.html#leading-organizations)
to the program.

## Team Members

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Director, Contributor Success') %>

### File an issue

#### gitlab-org/gitlab

All issues that relate to the Open Source project GitLab and that can serve to enhance the contributor flow and are public by nature should be created here by default. We aim to not have any distinction between contributors or GitLab team-members for which we expect by default that everyone should be able to contribute to. 

* Location: [gitlab-org/gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)
* Required label: `Contributor Success`

#### gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task

All issues that relate to the inner working of the company GitLab, including specific internal team workings, onboardings-issues or issues relating to customers that should be separated from the Open Source project GitLab can be placed here.

* Location: [gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task/)
* Required label: `Contributor Success`

## Project Management

* Our [team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team-task) is our single source of truth for all tasks & backlog.

## OKRs

Every quarter, the team commits to [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](/company/okrs/). The below links to our current and
previous quarter OKRs, it updates automatically as the quarter progresses.

## How we plan work

The team uses the [Contributor Growth board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/boards/4879276). 
Everything that we're working actively is present above the cut-line. Our planning is always focussed on achieving our PIs & [OKRs](#okrs).

5 labels are present

* `~contributorgrowth::velocity`
  * Everything that relates to [Improving Contribution Velocity](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html#improve-contribution-velocity) as defined by our [Open Source Growth Strategy](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html)
* `~contributorgrowth::increase value`
  * Everything that relates to [Increasing Contribution Value](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html#increase-contribution-value) as defined by our [Open Source Growth Strategy](/handbook/engineering/open-source/growth-strategy.html)

  * Everything that relates to internal processes such as onboarding, internal issues such as tooling or customer & company specific tasks.


### Monthly planning meeting

Once a month, in the 3rd week of the month, we use the [Contributor Success stand-up](#contributor-success-stand-up) to review how we progressed. 
We define what goes above the cutline and what should go below the cutline in order to meet our OKRs & PIs for the 
quarter. We re-assess the importance and make sure to disseminate our learnings.

## Contributor Success Retrospective

Every 2 weeks we hold an asynchronous retrospective in the [`#g_contributor_success-confidential`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C04KENT97K7) channel using Geekbot.
Questions asked are

* What should we start?
* What should we stop?
* What should we continue?

Contributor Success' DRI is responsible for summarizing the discussion and creating an issue in the team tracker 
[`gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/contributor-success/team/-/issues) 
so that it can be easily retrieved in the future. 

Contributor Success' DRI is responsible for taking the feedback to the monthly planning meeting.

## Contributor Success stand-up

The purpose of this stand-up is to collaborate between teams members of Contributor Success. This is a team-specific
meeting to check in on blockers, progress and ways to think differently & iterate towards our goals.

We're reviewing the Contributor Growth weekly, making sure our active work is aligned towards our OKRs and towards the new insights we get from our PIs.

## Contributor Growth stand-up

The purpose of this stand-up is to collaborate cross-functionally between various teams and GitLab team members on
initiatives for how to reach our goal of 1000 contributors per month. This is a subset of the User Engagement top
