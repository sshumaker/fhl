## OPERATIONAL

## How to reach Legal 
### üé• [Watch the "How to Reach Legal" Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCLagn_sWSI)
*Learn about how to open a Legal Request, When to Open a Legal Request; 2:24 (Log into GitLab Unfiltered)*

1. **UPDATE TO PROCESS:** Please note, the "Legal Request Button" will now be available exclusively in the Opportunity template layout. The purpose of this update was to enable Legal to gather more information regarding Legal Requests created and the applicable Opportunity information. If an Opportunity does not exists, please open a $0 Opportunity to then create the Legal Request following the steps within this Section and the video.  
2. For all questions related to Partners and/or Customers, including: Non-standard NDA requests, Contract Review / Negotiations, Legal Questions...etc., please open a **Legal Request** in SFDC. 
3. There is a:
     * $25K ARR opportunity minimum threshold to review edits to our terms; and
     * $100K ARR opportunity minimum threshold to review Customer.
     
* **Please Note** The above thresholds are based on a single opportunity and not the "total Account value" or "total Contract value", OR, potential investment size of a future opportunity. For clarity, if a Customer is purchasing $30,000USD over three (3) year term, this Opportunity **WOULD NOT** meet the threshold for negotiation(s). 
    
* With respect to non-standard NDAs, the above thresholds do not apply. Simply follow the same process(es) and attach the Customer red-lined GitLab NDA, OR, the Customer's NDA template.

4. Step-by-Step directions on opening a Legal Request can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#request-editable-version-of-gitlab-template)
_NOTE:_ Once you open a Legal Request for "Contract Review", **DO NOT** open another Legal Request when updated red-lines are provided. All red-lines / negotiated versions will be stored in one (1) Legal Request to ensure version history is maintained. 
5. A presentation on this topic can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lesWNvPAFd1B3RuCgKsqQlE85ZEwLuE01QpVAKPhQKw/edit#slide=id.g5d6196cc9d_2_0)

### **To Request a Legal Review for a Channel Partner Contract**

For Channel and Alliance Partner contract reviews _only_, the process for the legal request is as follows:
1. Navigate to the partner account record in SFDC.
2. Click the legal request button.
3. Choose ‚ÄúPartner Agreement‚Äù in the dropdown menu
4. Follow the process as the system lays out

## How do I get an Agreement signed
*Learn about how to get an Agreement Signed; Who can sign on behalf of GitLab*

1. **Sales Reps cannot sign any Agreements.** Only certain individuals may execute on behalf of GitLab see Authorization Matrix [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix). 
2. All Agreements require a GitLab Legal stamp in order to be executed. This stamp is placed by a Contract Manager when an executable version is reached. 
3. Once the Agreement has been stamped by GitLab legal, follow the [DocuSign Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-send-an-order-form-to-the-customer-for-signature-via-docusign) to send the Agreement for signature within SFDC. **Note:** All Sales Team Members have Docusign access, please work with Sales Ops for any questions on how to use. 

**Additional Resources:**
- Visit [Sales Order Processing](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/) for helpful information.

#### **Need an NDA signed?** Follow the process for [Team Members with Docusign access](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/). 

### Letters of Authorization

Visit the [Channel Operations page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#letters-of-authorization) to learn how partners can request a Letter of Authorization.

**Legal Team Steps:**
- Once the Channel Account Manager has approved the LOA, the Legal Team will receive an email via DocuSign to `loa@gitlab.com`.
- The Legal Team will then follow the link to view the document, add the date and click ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù on the LOA to indicate that the information is correct and the partner is authorized, then click Finish to forward the signed LOA to the partner.

## Clear Export Review in SFDC
1. See the [Visual Compliance Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hD1xgEyJL1U1eyvTci6NNlCdIur4PkB16GO52wjZRgk/edit#slide=id.g5dbc2f529a_0_41)
2. GitLab uses Visual Compliance to review all Accounts. The tool is continually reviewing and 'clearing' Accounts. In addition, any 'flags' / 'hits' are reviewed and cleared throughout the day by GitLab Legal.
3. If an export notice is presented, that requires immediate action, please tag "@legal" in SFDC Chatter for the Account and write "Please review for export compliance"
4. Legal will continually review all requests. Once cleared in Visual Compliance update(s) will reaching SFDC in 15-20 minutes. 

## Completing Vendor Request Forms

**It is the sales team member responsibility to complete Vendor Request Forms**
1. Much, if not all, of the Vendor Form information can be found at the [Company Information Page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Finance-Division/finance/-/wikis/company-information)

**Included on the Company Information Page is:**
- Address / information related to each GitLab entity
- All banking information
- ECCN Number
- NAICS Code
- Dun and Bradstreet Number
...AND VARIOUS OTHER DETAILS
- W9 is located on the Finance [Forms page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#forms)
- For Customers that request an Insurance Certificate for evidence of coverage, please open a Legal Request.

1.  If there are questions / elements that are not found in the Company Information Page, the Sales Rep should engage Deal Desk to organize requests of finance and tax. Information regarding contacting Deal Desk and overall process can be found at the [Sales Order Process Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-process-customer-requested-vendor-setup-forms).

2.  If there are Security related questions / elements that are not found at the [GitLab Trust Center Page](https://about.gitlab.com/security/) or the [GitLab Customer Assurance Package Page](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/), the Sales Rep should engage the Field Security Team per their process, which can be found at [GitLab's Customer Assurance Activities Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html).

3. **ONLY OPEN A LEGAL REQUEST IF:** There is a specific legal question / element being requested within the Vendor Form.

Example: Has GitLab, or board member / executed of GitLab, been subject to a lawsuit? 
 
**As a private company, we will not share the following information in a Vendor Request Form:** 
- Stock / Share ownership of the company
- Finances, including annual and/or historical performance 

## What's needed to close a Deal
### üé• Watch the ["What's needed to close a Deal" Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhxHY6xk938)

1. Visit the [Sales Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/) and [Deal Desk](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/) Handbook materials to review how to create an Order Form. 
2. An Order Form with a base Agreement referenced. This will either be the current [Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/) as found at the [Terms of Service](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/#current-terms-of-use), or, if an executed Agreement is signed, this will be referenced within the Order Form. 
3. Visit the presentation on the [Legal Requirements](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IaGO8j--WOKZqAwuBQjKJJN0hU7rfpdgbIoj_kClGK0/edit#slide=id.g5d6196cc9d_2_219) _Note: This is locked for GitLab Team Members only_
4. The fastest way to close a deal is to ensure the Customer signs the Order Form. If a Customer refuses to sign an Order Form, additional approvals will be required by both GitLab Legal and Finance team members. In addition, the Customer may need to make changes to their Purchase Order (PO). 


## Requests for GitLab Financial Information, Tax and Insurance Certificates

1. For Tax Certificate requests please email the Finance team at [tax@gitlab.com](mailto:tax@gitlab.com)
2. For Insurance Certificate requests, demonstrating evidence of coverage, please open a Legal Request
3. Regarding GitLab financial information, GitLab is a public company and its public filings can be found on SEC.gov or on [GitLab's Investor Relations website](https://ir.gitlab.com/financial-information/sec-filings)


## How to get a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) signed
GitLab includes a signed version of the DPA on the [Terms of Service](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/), as stated within the [Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/) this DPA is applicable to all Enterprise Customer's and does not need to be counter-signed. In addition, as stated within the header of the DPA, a Customer‚Äôs acceptance of the Subscription Agreement shall be treated as its execution of the DPA.  

## Escalation Process
In instances where a Customer or a Partner has requested material non-standard terms that are not generally accepted, and where the transaction may merit additional consideration, please follow the [Escalation Process Overview](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19ZHBpaRmmFJNG2BTp-Q5zI20yzt_X0Yr). Included in the Overview are the steps required to meet threshold requirements, ensure the matter receives the appropriate level of review, and provide guidance to complete the applicable Escalation Form(s) _Note This document is only available for GitLab Team Members._ 

## CLM Process
- Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) is a tool that enables the Commercial Legal Team to capture and report data related to legal and business terms. The ultimate goal of the CLM is to make the Legal process more efficient during the CPQ / quote-to-cash process and provide more visibility into the internal request process. Steps the Commercial Legal Team follows after an Agreement has been fully executed include:
    1. Upload the fully executed version, which is to be saved in the SFDC Legal Request by the Sales Team Member, into the CLM tool via the Legal Request Case;
    2. Complete the "Upload Intake Form" with the elements / information related to the Agreement being uploaded; and 
    3. Hit "Save" 
-  By uploading / saving the document in the CLM, the information supplied via the Intake Form will be stored in both the CLM, as well as in the Account details in SFDC. In addition, the fully executed version will be stored in the CLM Repository for ease of retrieval. 

## RFP Process
With regards to completing RFPs, sometimes referred to as RFIs, RFQs or RFXs, please find information in the [RFP Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/Field-Security-RFP.html) handbook page.

### üé• [Watch the "When does GitLab Negotiate Video"](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYvZKP5OohA)
*Learn about when GitLab negotiates; 3:20 (Log into GitLab Unfiltered)*

**Note:** The updated NDA process may not be referenced in the video, please follow most recent directions in this Sales Guide

1. GitLab will negotiate NDAs with our prospects. You can always send the prospect the GitLab NDA template (following the steps within this Sales Guide) and ask for them to sign. If they want to use their template, simply open a Legal Request for "Contract Review".
2. GitLab will negotiate changes to our terms and conditions provided the [current] Opportunity is greater than $25K (USD).
3. GitLab will negotiate using a Customer terms and conditions-if they are applicable to our Software and business-if the [current] Opportunity is greater than $100K (USD).
4. **Why don't we negotiate with all Customers?** Using resources to negotiate on all deals would not be a good use of GitLab resources and instead, we created our terms to be reasonable and in line with industry standards which allows us to place our resources into creating better products and services.

## Why GitLab does not sign BAAs

1. **GitLab will not sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**

2. Resources to provide your Customer if they request a BAA:

**What do the GitLab Terms say?**
- GitLab is transparent with respect to information it requires, or does not require, in order to provide our products and services. Please view [Section 14.3 of the Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#14-security--data-protection), which specifically highlights that GitLab will not receive Personal Heatlh Information. 

**Why does GitLab not sign BAAs?**
- GitLab does not require nor is designed to be used to store Personal Health Information (PHI). In addition, GitLab, as an organiztion, does not desire or need to receive, process, store, transact or otherwise possess PHI in order to provide our products and servcies. As such, GitLab does not meet, or desire to meet, the definition of a "Business Associate" as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  
- In the event a Customer questions "incidental dislcosures", please highlight the HIPAA definition itself, which states: _‚ÄúBusiness associate functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity include claims processing, data analysis, utilization review, and billing.  Business associate services to a covered entity are limited to legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services. **However, persons or organizations are not considered business associates if their functions or services do not involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, and where any access to protected health information by such persons would be incidental, if at all.**‚Äù_

## Intro to Data Privacy and the GitLab Data Processing Addendum

1. The [GitLab Privacy Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/) explains how GitLab collects, uses and shares customers' personal information, and how they may exercise their rights in respect of that information. More information about privacy compliance at GitLab, including answers to a number of frequently asked questions concerning the GDPR, can be found on the [GitLab Privacy Compliance](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/privacy-compliance/) handbook page.
1. The GitLab Data Processing Addendum, usually referred to as the "DPA", can be accessed from the [GitLab Terms of Service page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/raw/master/BR_signed_Hosted_DPA_V1-brobins_gitlab.com.pdf). As stated in the [GitLab Subscription Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/subscription-agreement/#14-security--data-protection), the terms of the DPA automatically apply to corporate customers.
1. When asking questions about data privacy, Customers may also raise questions about security. Generally, such questions are best directed to the [Field Security Team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/#contact-the-field-security-team). However, the following resources may be useful in the first instance:
    - The [Security Practices handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/) gives details about GitLab's organizational security.
    - GitLab's [Customer Assurance Package](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-assurance-package.html) provides details of GitLab's current Security and Compliance posture.
    - GitLab documentation explaining how to [_Secure your application_](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/), [_Secure your installation_](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/) and the [_GitLab permissions guide_](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html) are useful for helping customers understand steps they can take to secure the personal data processed in GitLab.
