# GitLab API Terms of Use

A. These API Terms of Use (“**API Terms**”) form a binding contract between you and GitLab and explain your rights and obligations when using GitLab’s publicly-available application programming interfaces (the “**GitLab APIs**”).

B. “**We**”, “**our**” **and** “**us**” refers to GitLab Inc. and “**you**” and “**your**” refers to the individual, or company or other legal entity, on behalf of which the GitLab APIs are used.

C. If you are using the GitLab APIs on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these API Terms. If you do not have such authority, or do not agree with these API Terms, you must not use the GitLab APIs.

D. These API Terms do not apply to your use of the software, and other products and services, made available by GitLab (the “**GitLab Software**”), including without limitation, the self-managed and SaaS versions of GitLab’s DevOps Lifecycle Application Platform. Your use of the GitLab Software is subject to a separate written agreement between you and GitLab or one of its affiliates entered into prior to such use.

E. We may revise these API Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when posted. Your continued use of the GitLab APIs following the posting of revised API Terms signifies your acceptance of the revised API Terms.

F. In the event of an inconsistency between these API Terms and those of an agreement governing (i) your use of the GitLab Software; or (ii) your partnership with GitLab, the provisions of such other agreement(s) will prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.
