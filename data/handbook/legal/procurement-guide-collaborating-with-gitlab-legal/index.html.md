## Overview
Thank you for visiting! The purpose of this resource is to provide GitLab team members with information on how legal assists and interacts with the procurement of products and services at GitLab. 

For information on the Procurement Team, policies and process, visit [The Procurement Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/)

For general questions that **_do not_** require legal advice, deliverables, or any discussion of confidential information, you can reach out to the GitLab Legal Team at *[`#legal`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/legal)*.

## Contacting Legal
You don't need to reach out to GitLab Legal directly, instead the GitLab Legal Team will be enaged directly by the Procurement Team, as applicable. 

## When is Legal involved
GitLab Legal will review any and all purchases made to ensure adequate terms are present for GitLab. Examples of types of purchases include:
- Software Agreements;
- Professional Services Agreements;
- Sponsorship Agreements;
- Event Contract;
- Subcontracting Agreements (staff augmentation or providing services/resources to GitLab and/or GitLab customers)

## Signing Contracts 
**DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS**

- Only authorized individuals can execute contracts on behalf of GitLab. Please view the [Signatory Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/authorization-matrix/#authorization-matrix) for who may sign.  

- In order to be executed, all Contracts must include the GitLab Legal stamp. This stamp confirms that the Contract has been reviewed and approved by a Legal Team Member. If you do not receive a GitLab Legal stamped version of the Contract, please ask the Procurement Team Member for assistance.

## NDA Process
- Prior to exchanging any confidential information, GitLab and a potential Vendor should execute a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement. This will ensure the adequate protection of any / all information shared. 
- Follow the [Non-Disclosure Agreement process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/) to send an NDA via DocuSign or request one if you do not have DocuSign access.
- NOTE: If a potential vendor requires the use of their NDA template, please follow the process located on the [Procurement Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/) which will initiate the legal review process. 

## Negotiating Terms
- For any purchases made by GitLab, there must be applicable terms and conditions. 
- GitLab prefers to use the [Standard Terms and Conditions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/procurement/vendor-guidelines/#standard-vendor-terms-and-conditions), which includes terms related to purchasing both software and/or professional services.
- For information regarding purchase requests and negotiation thresholds, please visit the [Procurement handbook](/handbook/finance/procurement/).

## GitLab Legal Procurement Process
- Within the GitLab PO tool, the GitLab Legal Commercial (Procurement) team is grouped as "Legal", and is listed as part of the "Approval Chain Requirements". 
- Upon a Req. being opened, a GitLab Legal Commercial (Procurement) Team Member will carry out the following actions:
    1. Click "Add" Approver;
    2. Will include the name of the GitLab Legal Commercial (Procurement) Team Member who will review the request (which may be themself) and select "After Current Approver", and then hit "Add"; and
    3. The Team Member will then add a comment that the Req. is being "Approved" to the applicbale Team Member, and will hit "Approve". 
- By carrying out the above steps, the Req. will be added to the applicable Team Memebrs "To-Do" and will result in ensuring Team Members are not carrying out duplicative work.

## Requesting a Certificate of Insurance
To request a COI, open an issue in the Legal and Compliance project using the [general legal template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=general-legal-template&_gl=1*1aumr6r*_ga*MTc1Mjg0Mzg3NS4xNjc1NzE0NjA5*_ga_ENFH3X7M5Y*MTY3NjQ4OTU3Ny4xMC4xLjE2NzY0ODk2ODkuMC4wLjA). Be sure to apply the `legal-procurement::to do` label and tag `@rnalen`, `@chilling32`, and `@ddowney` in your request.
