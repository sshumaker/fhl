#### Purpose and Mission

The purpose of GitLab’s (“**Company**”) internal audit team (“**IA Team**”) is to provide independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and improve the Company’s operations. The internal audit department helps the Company accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes. 

<br>

#### Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing 

The internal audit department will govern itself by adherence to the mandatory elements of The Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional Practices Framework, including the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the Company’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics (the “**Code of Ethics**”), the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (the “**Standards**”), and the Definition of Internal Auditing. The Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit will report periodically to the Company’s E-Group and the Company’s Board of Directors’ [Audit Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) (“**Committee**”) regarding the internal audit department’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards. 

<br>

#### Authority 

The Company's Vice President, Internal Audit will report functionally to the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) and administratively (i.e., day-to-day operations) to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. To establish, maintain, and assure that the IA Team has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties, the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) will: 
* Approve the IA Team’s charter. 
* Approve the risk-based internal audit plan and budget. 
* Receive communications from the Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit on the IA Team’s performance relative to its plan and other matters. 
* Make appropriate inquiries of Company management and the Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit to determine whether there is inadequate scope or resource limitations.

The Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit will have unrestricted access to, and communicate and interact directly with, the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/), as necessary, including in private meetings without Company management present. 

The [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) authorizes the IA Team to:

* Obtain assistance from the necessary personnel of the Company, as well as other specialized services from within or outside the Company, in order to complete any engagement.

<br>

#### Independence and Objectivity 

The Vice President, Internal Audit will ensure that the IA Team remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of internal auditors to carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and report content. If the Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit determines that independence or objectivity may be impaired in fact or appearance, the details of impairment will be disclosed to the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/). 

Members of the IA Team will maintain an unbiased attitude that allows them to perform engagements objectively and in such a manner that they have confidence in their work product, that no quality compromises are made, and that they do not subordinate their judgment on audit matters to others. 

Members of the IA Team will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited. Accordingly, members of the IA Team will not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair their judgment, including: 

* Assessing specific operations for which they had responsibility within the previous year. 
* Performing any operational duties for the Company or its subsidiaries. 
* Initiating or approving transactions external to the IA Team. 
* Directing the activities of any Company team member not on the IA Team, except to the extent that such team members have been appropriately assigned to internal audit auditing teams or to otherwise assist members of the IA Team. 

Where the Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit has or is expected to have roles and/or responsibilities that fall outside of internal auditing, safeguards will be established by the IA team and approved by the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) to limit impairments to independence or objectivity. 

Members of the IA Team will: 
* Disclose any impairment of independence or objectivity, in fact or appearance, to the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/). 
* Exhibit objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. 
* Make balanced assessments of all available and relevant facts and circumstances. 
* Take necessary precautions to avoid being unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments. 

The Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit will report and confirm to the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/), at least annually, the organizational independence of the internal audit department. 

The Company’s Vice President, Internal Audit will disclose to the [Committee](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/board-meetings/committees/audit/) any interference and related implications in determining the scope of internal auditing, performing work, and/or communicating results.
