## InnerSource Workshop Overview

This workshop is intended to provide enablement for new or existing customers that have voiced interest in InnerSource or how to become better at collaborating across their organization. The expected outcome is that a customer has successfully setup a GitLab project in an InnerSource ready fashion, including secrets-detection using GitLab CI.

* Start with understanding their "why" with [discovery questions](#discovery-questions)
* Share the ["Unlocking InnerSource with GitLab" webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS1mCpBHXaI) asynchronously 
* For a more high-touch customer you can offer them an executive level overview and/or a hands-on workshop
  * **Session 1** (15 - 30 min.) is an overview of the value prop for an organization, a customer proof point, as well as a quick start guide 
  * **Session 2** (30 - 45 min.) is a Hands-on workshop where the customer is expected to bring an InnerSource ready project to the table and configure it with our guidance
* After the workshop(s), record whether or not the customer has successfully built a GitLab CI pipeline; use this opportunity to pitch the value of [service ping](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d28buwnzM4xKADU1OC6dU6HXd3KqBurG_tIEag7BJMw/edit#slide=id.g10928a67270_0_636) (internal link) if you haven't done so recently

*Note*: You can combine the two sessions into one if you don't have a different audience. When we were trialing this playbook, we had sr. leadership/sponsors for the first session and practitioners in the second session.

## Discovery Questions
The goal of the discovery questions is to help your customer tie this back to a larger initiative and identify a champion who will sponsor their efforts. The champion is who you will be running Session 1 with.

* Tell me about your use case for innersource. Does it show up explicitly in a transformation or company goal?
* What is it that you’re hoping InnerSource will accomplish for your company? What outcome?
* How is source code classified within your company? (i.e. “highly secure”/least privilege?)
* What do you use for secrets management and secrets detection?
* Who is championing innersource?
* Do you have a use case in mind?
