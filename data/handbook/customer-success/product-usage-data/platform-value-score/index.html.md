## Platform Value Score

### Vision

In alignment with our mission to be deliver the DevSecOps platform, Platform Value is meant to measure our customer’s deployment of the platform as a whole. We believe that as we help our customer’s to improve their deployment of the Gitlab platform they will “maximize the return on software development”.

### Definition

Platform Value Score shows a customer’s Product adoption depth achieved with GitLab.

A customer’s score is the number of Use Cases they have adopted to a green health level as defined by the corresponding thresholding. We have determined that once a customer has adopted 3 or more Use Cases they have begun realizing Platform Value. Platform Value Scoring depends heavily on the [Use Case Adoption measures](/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/maturity-scoring/) that we calculated using metrics generated through our customer’s product usage data. A customer’s score is simply the number of Use Cases that they have adopted to a green level as defined by the corresponding thresholding. We have determined that once a customer has adopted 3 or more Use Cases they have begun realizing Platform Value.

### How we use Platform Value Scores

Customer Success conversations: - First and foremost, we want our customers to be successful. We believe that most of their goals will align with the value that using Gitlab as a platform can provide. As such, our CSMs use the scores as an input into how they prioritize their time with customers as well as to inform the conversations that they’re having.
Internal Key Performance Indicator: - Internally we aggregate the Platform Value Scores by reporting on the % of our ARR that falls within certain levels of Platform Value (i.e. 0, 1, 2, and 3+ Use Cases adopted).
Sales Feedback Loop: Sellers need to know how their customers are using GitLab, and how they can assist customers realize more value and provide recommendations.
Product Feedback Loop: These metrics are shared with Product to better understand the adoption of GitLab across all customers.
