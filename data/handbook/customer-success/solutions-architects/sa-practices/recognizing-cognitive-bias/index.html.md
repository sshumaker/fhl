How to facilitate Cognitive Bias exercise:

1. Create a survey to collect information & feedback from team members about their own bias. This can be potentially recognized by reading the Top 10 most common cognitive biases above. Feel free to use [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczPQ8GhjRfLTjnUBj-Oio1JfUb5J4BqjzLKyQTYTaXv7vwiw/viewform).
1. In a small team meeting setting:
a. Summarize the results of the survey
b. Pick 2-3 examples for a role-playing exercise
c. Discuss the results & exercise
Example of the exercise [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yGeNl-dGUFZM2I9RY-3J7ZdslaGw1Vu_xSSm0r2qHH8/edit?usp=sharing)
