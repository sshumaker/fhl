## Solutions Architecture Mission

To drive our customers' success through technical and business consultation. 

While using technical and domain-specific expertise, Solutions Architects strive to become [trusted advisors](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/#trusted-advisors) to our prospects, customers, and partners. Solutions Architects have the following primary objectives:

- Gain a deep technical understanding of our customers biggest challenges, the impacts they have on their business, and collaborate as a strategic partner when determining the most effective solutions


- Deliver impactful value propositions for prospects before they become GitLab customers


- Drive successful adoption of the GitLab platform by our customers 


- Grow the business partner ecosystem by developing partner capabilities and building joint solutions


## Role & Responsibilities

### Solutions Architects (Field)
Field [Solutions Architects](/job-families/sales/solutions-architect/) (SA) are the trusted advisors to GitLab prospects and customers during the presales motion. We demonstrate how the GitLab platform and GitLab Professional Services address common and unique business requirements. SA's add value to GitLab's customers by providing subject matter expertise and industry experience throughout the sales process and collaborate internally with product.

In addition, SA's identify and propose comprehensive solutions to complex business problems and workflow scenarios after compiling inputs from customer requests during conversations. Desired inputs include pain points, role-based visibility concerns, opportunities for improved efficiencies, current technologies and tools (3rd party to GitLab) and therefore opportunities to improve integrations, corporate initiatives, target outcomes and more. SA's also act as the technical liaison between the sales team and other groups within GitLab, engaging GitLab employees from other teams as needed in order meet the needs of the customer.

Our Field SA's also engage proactively with existing GitLab customer to provide thought-leadership, engage in innovative solutions, collaborate around evangalism activities around unique customer requirements (i.e. meetups and presentations) and continously seek market feedback to improve the GitLab platform.

## Trusted Advisors

Being a Trusted Advisor is referencing a role/skill that a person takes on when working with customers to solve their business problem.

> **Building Trust (Trusted Advisor)**:  
> Connects with key stakeholders on both a personal and professional level and shows up as a credible and reliable champion for customers. Effectively positions GitLab as a partner to the customer rather than just another vendor with a focus on following through on commitments and delivering results.
