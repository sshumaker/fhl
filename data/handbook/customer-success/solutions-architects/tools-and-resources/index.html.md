## Tools and Resources
{:.no_toc}

Tools and resources provide infomation to help Solution Architects to conduct POV or workshops, respond to RFx, manage customer facing activities, support on-going product learning.

### Education and Enablement

As a Solutions Architect, it is important to be continuously learning more about our product and related industry topics. The [education and enablement handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/education-enablement/) provides a dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed.

### Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines

Proof of Value (POV), formerly known as Proof of Concept, is conducted during the Technical Evaluation stage with Solutions Architects by  prospects or existing customers to assess the required capabilities based on a set of criteria and value drivers. A POV is a collaboration between GitLab and the prospective or existing customer for evaluating GitLab. Information on the POV guidelines, POV types and process can be found on the [Proof of Value (POV) Guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/pov/) page.

### SaaS Trials for Existing Customers

Paid customers must set up a new namespace on SaaS when trialing Ultimate.  There are two primary reasons for this: 

1. some paid features are not available in a trial, so a customer might lose functionality they had been using if a trial license is applied
2. GitLab does not have an appropriate mechanism for applying and reverting a trial license on SaaS without the namespace potentially being reverted to free when the trial expires ([see issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12186))

Both situations put customer production GitLab usage at risk if a trial is applied to the SaaS namespace.

Instead, a customer should create a new namespace and trial there.  We have put together some [SaaS trial guidelines](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/saas-trial-guidelines/) in order to make the process as seamless as possible for customers.



### Hands-on Workshops

GitLab Solutions Architects conduct hands-on workshops as interactive events for GitLab prospects and customers to learn the GitLab product and DevSecOps capabilities. Workshops may be executed as marketing events or run independently for specific customers. Detail information is provided on the [Hands-on Workshops](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/tools-and-resources/workshop/) page.

### RFI/RFP Responses 

RFx's such as RFI and RFP are common steps in the public sector yet it may be required by enterprise customers to assess, evaluate and procure the software. Solution architects often participate in the RFP process responding to the technical asks and solutions requirements. Information on responding to the RFx can be found on the [RFI/RFP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/Field-Security-RFP.html) page.

### CS Knowledge Base

[The Customer Success Knowledge Base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture/sa-knowledge-base/) is a private project for use primarily by Customer Success to capture important information that we research, discover, or otherwise stumble upon so that it can be reused in the future in responses to customer questions or RFI/RFPs. 

New KB Articles can be added to the project by:

- Creating a new issue directly from the project
- Reacting to a Slack post in \#cs-questions or \#solutions-architects with the :kb: ![kb.jpg](./kb.jpg) emoji which will trigger a workflow that
    - prompts the user with a Slack form to provide a title for the KB issue entry. This needs to be completed within 1 minute
    - creates a KB Article in the CS Knowlege Base project and then posts a link to the issue in the Slack thread

### Product Releases

Solution architects have to keep up the pace of the GitLab monthly product releases to position feature sets and capabilities for the prospect and customer needs while demostrating the market leading position. 

Following links provide product release information to assist in tehnical discussions and technical evaluation.

### Customer Facing Meeting Tools

Solutions Architects frequently interact with customers for demos, presentations or Q&A. These calls should enable the customer to clearly experience the value of GitLab without distraction or interruption. The below list of tools was compiled by the GitLab SA team as commonly used solutions. Note, this list does not represent a requirement to use any of these products or an endorsement for these products.

### Useful Customer Facing Presentations

No two presentations are the same and we often find ourselves mixing and matching content tailored to our Customer's journey.  From Agile to CI/CD to Kubernetes and beyond, below are several commonly used decks rich in content to pull from.

- [Official Customer Facing Presentations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/#customer-facing-presentations) - Here you will find the [Company Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dVPaGc-TnbUQ2IR7TV0w0ujCrCXymKP4vLf6_FDTgVg/) with the GitLab narrative, [Customer Value Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SHSmrEs0vE08iqse9ZhEfOQF1UWiAfpWodIE6_fFFLg/) with Value Drivers and Differentiators, and [Security Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WHTyUDOMuSVK9uK7hhSIQ_JbeUbo7k5AW3D6WwBReOg/edit?usp=sharing) with best practices on Shift-Left security.   _These should be the starting point of any tailored deck!_
- [All The Things](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGMyciRrobnOgazoc20_Q5HiBcP8ydp_JWjzgBj4tRI/) - Not a pitch deck.  Owned by a Solution Architect, this is a holistic, tactical guide to GitLab as a Product constantly updated with screenshots.
