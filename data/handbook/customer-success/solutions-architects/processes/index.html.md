# Solutions Architects Processes
{:.no_toc}

## SA Process Maps

The SA organization uses process mapping as a framework for structured and continuous improvement.  LucidChart is used to document SA execution workflow and details; in other words, what we do and how we do it is documented as a visual process map.  This provides a single location to find reusable artifacts, enablement, and tooling. 

The goals of SA process mapping are inclusive of the following:

- To be prescriptive and deliberate with SA activities in order to continuously increase efficiency and effectiveness
- Faster SA onboarding
- Make more of what we do measurable
- Hold each other accountable
- Make it easier to collaborate and iterate on what we did
- Create a repeatable process for all SAs to collaborate with our customers

SA process mapping is not meant to restrict creativity, experimentation, or improvement.  As part of the SA Learning Organization, SAs are encouraged to challenge our mental models and focus on solving problems as a team.  If something can be done better, please try it out and share your learnings.  Contribute to our process maps and to the supporting handbook pages.

To following process maps are best viewed in full screen.  Please note that many of the map nodes are clickable, leading to other maps, handbook pages, or other supporting artifacts.

## SA Activity Capture

Solutions Architects record all customer and prospect activity to promote **transparency** and **collaboration**. By consistently capturing our customer facing activity, we can perform analysis for further reporting to establish **efficient** decision making for GitLab's business. More information on this process can be found on the [SA Activity Capture](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/activity-capture/) page.

We have a [standard meeting notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlG1ZDKtd3YcV_yZg9YxQ52HRxNCpYXJLyDblxBz-vU/edit?usp=sharing) that is formatted to enable the activity capture in Troops which should be utilised for each customer engagement

## Positioning Professional Services

Solutions Architects should be pitching professional services at every qualified customer opportunity due to long term customer sucess and growth. Please use this [deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pXPE84FAv4zhFBwwM7cSy0WbhjUeJ7mrbp1PPjxLBaA/edit#slide=id.g122779ad4b2_0_0) and [rubric](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pXPE84FAv4zhFBwwM7cSy0WbhjUeJ7mrbp1PPjxLBaA/edit#slide=id.g122779ad4b2_0_0) to familirize yourself with the catalog listed [here](https://about.gitlab.com/services/catalog/).
Please add "Positioned PS" as SA activity type after you have positoned it for your opportunity. 

## Engaging Professional Services

Follow the process detailed in the [Working with Professional Services](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/working-with/#for-sales-reps-and-sas-how-to-order-professional-services)
handbook page.

Simplified process description:

- Ensure that PS Opportunity has already been created by SAL / AE in SFDC.
- If it a standard (non-customized) service from our [full catalog](https://about.gitlab.com/services/catalog/).
    - SAL / AE to order PS directly from Zuora in SFDC.
- If standard services do not meet the needs of the customer
    - Use the [Services Calculator](http://services-calculator.gitlab.io/) to generate an issue and a draft quote.
    - Iterate on that issue with PS and SAL / AE.

## Customer Security Assurance

Follow the process detailed in the [GitLab's Customer Assurance Activities](/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html)
handbook page.


**Optional** Considerations when engaging the Customer Assurance team:

- You can start with [Security - GitLab Trust Center](https://about.gitlab.com/security/) in some cases.
- Encourage customers to use and review [Self-service Information Gathering](/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html).
- SAs can attempt a first-pass for all security questionnaires if time permits
    - Do it, itâ€™s fun and educational!
    - You can also make use of the [GitLab AnswerBase](/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/answerbase.html) (200+ pre-answered questions)
- Additional requests can be made in [#sec-fieldsecurity](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CV5A53V70) Slack Channel.
- When spending time on a security questionnaire ensure you capture the initial time dedicated via our SA Activity Capture system (troops).
## Generating Licenses

- SAs and SALs can use CustomersDot application to generate license
- It is recommended that SAs guide prospective and existing customers wanting to self-evaluate additional features via the GitLab Free trial offering for 30 days 
- In order to support prospects and customers, refer to the [Internal Support](/handbook/support/internal-support/#regarding-licensing-and-subscriptions) processes handbook page.

## Cross-functional Sales Team Processes

### Working Agreements

Enterprise Solutions Architects typically support sales teams made up of Sales Development Representatives, Strategic Account Leaders and Customer Success Managers. Commercial Sales Solutions Architects support Mid-Market Account Executives and SMB Customer Advocates in a pooled model. When joining a sales team, establishing working agreements is critical to providing optimal service to the customers as well as the GitLab team. A sample template of working agreements is found below to help facilitate conversation and establish these agreements:

1. **Customer response time for emails and meeting followups** I will always do my best to provide same-day responses to customer inquiries and follow ups unless otherwise noted. I like to provide customers top-notch service, but interruptions can affect that target. I will use my out of office when traveling so customers can expect delayed responses during those times. Feel free to contact me if it's approaching the end of the day and you didn't see me address a customer request. Slack is the easiest way to find me most of the time.
1. **Delivery Excellence** If the nature of my response requires a top-notch service needing me to contextualise my response in better and higher quality to our customers, I will collaborate with my GitLab sales team and set reasonable timelines for completions. Examples could be customized and tailored summaries of technical guidance as per our documentation (not just a url), suggested reference solutions architectures, and/or integrations with third-party technologies to GitLab. 
1. **Calendar** Schedule things as necessary right on my calendar during working hours - I'll do my best to keep my calendar up to date. However, if you see only one empty slot for a day or if it looks like the meeting would be back to back with something else, please check with me before confirming dates and times with the customer. If you want me at my best for you, I will need time to prepare and followup. If we schedule back to back, I've found I'm often late to arrive due to the last meeting, flustered as I context shift, lacking answers for known questions, unprepared with demo environments that were altered in the last call, etc.
1. **Regular communication** A weekly strategy hour-long call with the SA, SAL, SDR and CSM is preferred. If more frequent synchronous communication is desirable or required, we should work together as a team to identify a viable cadence, required attendees, convenient time and agenda for those calls. In either of those regular communication methods, documenting discussion points and agreements is essential.
1. **Elevated conversations** The more we focus on value and stay away from very deep technical and troubleshooting conversations, the more I can help you achieve target sales. I'm happy to review and contribute to business plans and strategies so we remain in sync.
1. **Professional Services** After careful assessment of the clients needs to drive faster adoption, I'm happy to recommend and propose required services for prospects and customers. I will write the initial SOW and get approvals from the Professional Services team.
1. **Travel** While strategic enterprise sales absolutely require travel, each day on the road can increase the volume of work and calls on other days of the week as my dialogs with customers often require extensive time commitments to research and model specific customer solutions. Please plan strategically when looking at on-sites, considering that I support at least two sales teams in my region. Additionally, please work with the customer when arranging for an on-site (or F2F) visit with 1 week's notice. This will allow me to ensure my commitment to attend and take alternative arrangements for family and other matters if needed.
1. **Notes** Unless otherwise directed, external call notes with customers will be linked to a Google document from Salesforce and stored in the Gdocs "GitLab Sales" directory. Email communication with customers will also be bcc'd to Salesforce. If you prefer to record notes and actions differently, please let me know what that collaborative method is and I will link it to the SA Activity process.
1. **Continuous learning** Things at GitLab move really fast, and I need time to keep up. I'll block a few hours on my calendar coincident with releases to absorb the latest GitLab feature set, but new technologies and competitive products also appear regularly. Please expect that I will need to allocate additional time to learning about those on a regular basis to sufficiently support our customers.

### Tool Usage within Cross-functional Teams

1. **Salesforce**
[To-do] Add info on views and reports to use during the sales cycle. Also, guidance on SA being listed on opportunities and accounts (there is not any info in our current handbook)
1. **Gainsight** Primarily for account planning in partnership with SAL and CSM. The easiest way to access Gainsight is via Salesforce. See the [Account Planning in Gainsight](/handbook/sales/gainsight/account-planning/) page for details.
1. **Slack** Create a public internal team slack channel for your cross-functional team. This will allow you to collaborate easily without sending DM's.
1. **Google Drive** There is a shared [GitLab Sales](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzQII5CcGHkKSFFJWkx3R1lUdGM?usp=sharing) folder. Running customer notes and other documents related to a specific customer should be stored in the [Customers and Prospects Subfolder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-ytP5bMib9Ta25aSi13Q25GY1U?usp=sharing) under the appropriate letter and customer name subfolder.
1. <b>[GitLab Account Management Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management)</b> may be used for a POV and/or CSM collaboration with a customer post-sale.
1. <b>[Chorus.ai](https://chorus.ai/)</b> is used to record meetings. The GitLab Notetaker will automatically join meetings with people outside of GitLab once your account is set up.

### Account Planning 

Account planning helps the SAL and the SA elevate opportunity-driven conversations into value-based conversations that focus on the customer's value drivers. It is a critical step in strategically supporting the customer at the account level, and facilitates more efficient opportunity planning. See the [Using Gainsight for SAs](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/account-planning) page for details. 

### Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR)

The entire cross-functional team should help in the preparation of the QBR content that either the Strategic Account Leaders or Commercial AEs will present during the QBR, and should participate in the QBR session. SAs should offer proactive assistance in matters related to articulation of technical win and success criteria details in the Sales reps owned QBR slides. It is often helpful to perform a dry run of the QBR with the area sales manager prior to the actual meeting, to review the content and timing of the presentation.

### Engaging an SA During the Sales Cycle

Solution Architects may participate in initial qualifying meetings (IQM's) or allow the SDR and SAL/AE to manage the initial call and utilize information gained during it for additional preparation. Teams can handle this on a case by case basis.

Once objectives and expectations have been established following the  [command of the message discovery](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/), we suggest a recommended review as an account team of information gathered. This will help us determine if qualification criterias have been met to proceed with further technical discovery or that the account requires further discovery of their outcomes. Solutions Architects oftentimes will have a unique perspective in a given opportunity and it is vital that this information is distilled and shared out, preferably through the command plan, to the rest of the account team.  

The perceived size of a given opportunity is not always reflective of the amount of effort that an SA ought to put into a given customer.  The requirements listed below are aimed at:

- Providing the SA to interface with as many opportunities as possible, by ensuring the proper preparation has been done prior to meeting with the customer
- Giving every customer increased confidence in the value they perceive through meeting with the SA and having them validate their plans
- Leveraging SAs exposure to opportunities to give SAs the autonomy to invest appropriate levels of time where they see the most amount of investment needed
- Reduce the onset of SFDC Opportunity confusion due to the lack of information provided or lack of in-depth knowledge within the varied technical domain(s) presented

When reaching out to engage SAs during opportunity qualification, discovery, and technical evaluations, please provide the below information. This will enable the SAs to accelerate execution, enable success, and promote consistent and quality opportunity outcomes aligned to the varied Sales roles and adopted strategies. The SAs reserve the right to decline the meeting if the below information is missing/not provided after being asked & if the correct personas are not engaged. We will review the exceptions on a case-by-case basis in case the below information is not provided and/or not qualified.

- Please provide active SFDC opportunity ID 
- Please provide link to the the associated and completed Command Plan
    - Ensure the Why Now?, Identified Pain, and Champion have been captured
- Any additional opportunity information (i.e. company overview and background, initiatives, desired outcomes, personas, etc.)
- Ensure that any scheduled or planned customer meetings have been discussed with the SA before customer engagement
  - What are we attempting to accomplish within the scheduled meeting? 
  - Are the objectives clear and understandable? 
  - Have expecatations been managed and cleary discussed? 

_Poorly positioned opportunities where the SAs has been engaged at the wrong time or without enough context will lead to SA burnout, stalled or prolonged sales cycles, and misalignment with the customers needs. It is critical that SAs are engaged when the Command Plan is leveraged, specifically the Why Now/Identify Pain are in sentence format._

Solution Architects should participate in [technical discovery](#technical-discovery-and-demo-preparation) after lead qualification is complete and in other activities during the sales process that lead to a technical win, e.g.

- GitLab demos
- GitLab technical deep dives
- Gitlab hands-on workshops
- Whiteboarding sessions
- Prospect Q&A sessions
- RFI/RFP completion
- PoV planning, documentation and execution strategy 
- [Security Audits](https://about.gitlab.comhandbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html)
- [SOW Scoping with Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/selling/)

SA's may also work in tandem with a CSM to support existing customers, especially when expand opportunities exist within the account. And SA's may also have regular touch points smaller customers who do not have a CSM assigned.

#### [SA/CSM Engagement Overlap]

- On a high level note, SAs are the pre-sales advisors for our prospective as well as existing customers and CSMs manage the post-sales relationship of existing customers and are responsible for the GitLab adoption.  

Further details can be found here: (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/#overlap-between-solution-architects-and-customer-success-managers)

#### Technical Discovery and Demo Preparation

The Solutions Architect, in order to tailor conversations and demos to demonstrate value as well as address current problem areas, will want to understand the following information, and may request further technical discovery() prior to any demo:

1. **Outcome:**

- Whatâ€™s in it for the client?
- Why look at a new strategy for software development?
- What triggered the sudden client interest in GitLab?

1. **Infrastructure:**

- What tools are currently in place?
- What tools have potential to be replaced?
- What processes or workflows have potential to change?

1. **Challenges:**

- What problems/roadblocks have been uncovered?
- What current process or technology is being utilized for what software development reasons? (i.e. what purpose does the developed application have?, What language is it written in?)
- What is the current release velocity?
- What is the current planning process?
- What visibility, traceability or efficiency concerns exist?
- What collaboration or governance opportunities exist?
- What security or compliance inefficiencies exist?

_Qualification criteria typically involves both Business requirements and Technical Functional/Non-Functional requirements *(i.e, Functional requirements explain how the system must work, while non functional requirements explain how the system should perform._ 

Once a technical discovery has been completed, SA will work within the account team to solidify a path forward (will the customer proceed with a purchase, trial, proof of value?) and idenitfy the corresponding metrics that will be used to determine the success of the evaluation.

## Solution Architect Engagement Models

## U.S. Enterprise Account and Opportunity Engagement Model

The Enterprise Strategic SA Engagement Model intends to foster collaboration and influence an even greater iteration amongst ourselves and customers.

Given that Landed Addressable Market (LAM or LAM Dev) might not always be correct and the Opportunity Net ARR isn't always indicative of the potential, this model segments an SA team's engagement by the AE role, so that the SA engagement model is aligned with the AE team structures.  

Solutions architects are responsible for owning their engagement on opportunities. The "engagement model" is a general recommendation, not a rule, and will be left to the discretion of the solutions architect.

For Major Account Executives, SAs are aligned with the account executives in their respective account activities.

For Strategic Account Executives, SAs are aligned with the account executives based on ongoing opportunities.

For Strategic Account Executives, the below process can be used to request a SA.: 

- The Strategic Account Executives will click on the "SA Request" button in salesforce after creation of a qualified opportunity.
- This requires information regarding the customer's pain points, why now and any additional information needed to get SA help.
- This information is pre filled from command plan and close plan if it exists. If this doesn't exist, then this will also be added back to the command plan and close plan
- This request is triaged through a slack channel and will be accepted by a SA which will populate the Primary SA field.
- The turn around time for a SA allocation is 24 hrs.
- Enterprise SAs will be dedicated through out the lifetime of the opportunity.
- Retaining SAs for multiple opportunities throughout the life cycle of an account or dedicated SA for SAL will be at SA/ASM manager discretion.
- The SA/SAL alignment will be visible on a report


Async Slack support

In some cases SA support might be required in early stage or not fully qualified opportunities. Slack can be used for answering technical questions, providing additional customer outreach materials or helping an Account Executive with a narrowly-scoped customer inquiry. These requests can be served asynchronously via Slack:

AMER EAST: #us-amer-east-sa-support
AMER WEST: #us-amer-west-sa-support

These Slack channels are considered to be a safe harbor for all enterprise AE <-> SA communication. When asking questions, please ensure you provide as much context as possible; including the SFDC URL, and type of subscription (SaaS or Self-Managed). Solutions Architecture will monitor and provide best effort support on these requests.


### EMEA Account Engagement Model

EMEA Enterprise Solutions Architects support the Major Account Executives (MAE) with an alignment model and the Stratigic Account Executives (SAE) with an SA Pool.

SAs are regionaly aligned to MAEs and aligned in their respective account activities. Each team collaborates according to standard [Working Agreements](#working-agreements), but they can be adjusted by teams individually.

SAEs are asked to request support on Opportunity basis via [this request form](https://enterprise-sa-request.vercel.app/).

Default alignment is maintained in the [EMEA AE-SA Alignment page](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/solutions-architecture/-/wikis/EMEA-SAL-SA-Alignment). 

When workload exceeds the SA's capacity or when there is a request from other departments, please reach out via **#emea-customer-success* Slack channel for assistance.

### Commercial Engagement Model

SA engagement for customer interactions, RFP's, audits and more ([how to engage a Commercial SA](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/commercial/)) can be requested by an SMB or Mid-Market Account Executive or other GitLab team-member using the appropriate GitLab issue board. Commercial boards exist for both the Americas and EMEA. The [Americas Commercial Triage Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/sa-triage-boards/commercial-triage/boards/1006966) and the [EMEA Commercial Triage Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/sa-triage-boards/emea-commercial-triage/-/boards) are leveraged by the team in order to ensure coverage for all sales activity. The issue creation and triage processes are described in detail below.

### APAC Account Engagement Model

APAC SAs are aligned regionally into regions such as ANZ, SEA (South-East Asia), India, South Korea and Japan in close alignment to the Strategic Account Leaders, Commercial AEs and Channels Managers territories. Teams collaborate to the standards [Working Agreements](#working-agreements). 

### Alliances SA Engagement Model
The Alliance SA team is global. The Alliance SA's are aligned with Alliance Partner Managers/Directors and the Alliance Business Development Managers. In customer accounts where an Alliance partner technology is involved, an Alliance SA engagement for customer interactions can be requested by an Account Executive / SA / CSM using the appropriate issue board. For more details, click on [how to engage an Alliance SA](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/alliance/). Here's the [Alliance Triage Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/alliances/gitlab-alliances-team/alliance-sa-work/-/boards/2245192) and the [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/alliances/gitlab-alliances-team/alliance-sa-work/-/issues/new?issuable_template=GitLab%20Internal%20Assistance) 

### Channel SA Engagement Model
The Channel SA's are aligned globally with the Channel program team as well as regionally with Channel Sales Directors and Channel Account Managers. Channel SA's are primarily focused on developing Partner relationships as opposed to direct Customer relationships.  Our primary community served are the regional Channel Sales Directors and their Channel Account Managers (CAMs), Partner teams, and our own managment.  Generally for direct customer opportunity support, engage the appropriate GitLab SA community for your customer.  Channel SA's can provide backup to the Customer SA community in support of a Partner aligned opportunity.  

Most Opportunity based enagement should start with the CAM and they should identify the appropriate Channel SA to engage.  If you do not know the CAM for your account / partner reach out via the `#channel-sales` slack channel for general sales questions about working with partners or finding help with a specific channel opportunity.  

In customer accounts where a Channel partner is involved, engagement with the Partner from a Channel SA can be requested by an Account Executive / SA / CSM.  For more details, click on [how to engage a Channel SA](/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/channel/).  The details on Channel SA engagement model can be found in this [RACI spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AxDrQp2HeIXfomw8QRrb0gemQCHktt_BR3ufpLTtxNc/).

### Issue Creation Details

1. Navigate to the correct board for your region. NOTE: All triage boards are located in the [SA Triage Boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/sa-triage-boards) group in projects broken out by region or engagement model.
1. Create a new issue.
1. Use one of the available templates:

- New activity: use the "SA Activity" template to ensure the proper data is collected and available
- Follow up activity: use the "Follow Up" template
- Security audit: use the "Vendor Security Assessment" template

1. To help the SA group ensure success for the client, the following information should be made available _prior_ to SA engagement

- **Customer Information**: Customer name, SFDC opportunity link
- **Preferred Date Options**: When would the customer want to have the call (including time zone information)
- **Target Hosting Environment**: Self-Managed, cloud or GitLab.com?
- **Challenges/Pain Points**: What is the customer pain/problems?
- **Required Capabilities**: What does the customer need?
- **Current Tools/Competitors**: What is the current tool set? Are any of those tools non-negotiable?
- **SA Asks**: What do you need from the SA's (demo, technical Q&A, SOW, etc.)

1. Add one or more of the following labels as needed (labels listed below).

### Board Label Descriptions

- **Open/no label**: Newly submitted issues
- **SA Triaged**: Issue ownership has been claimed by an SA
- **SA Demo Ready**: Prep has been completed for a customer interaction and further scheduling or conversations can now occur
- **Security Audit**: This request requires security team involvement, typically upon receiving a customer security questionnaire
- **Services Request**: If this opportunity focuses on services, use this label to indicate that
- **SA Doing**: Once an SA signals they are actively working the issue, the issue is moved to 'Doing'. The issue will stay in this status until the SA, customer and sales team agree the issue has been completed
- **SA Followup**: Followup work is required by the SA for this particular request (example: questions needing research after a call ends)
- **SA Waiting**: This label indicates that an SA is waiting on the requestor for more information before advancing this issue
- **SA POV**: A Proof of Value is being requested or needs support

### Triage of Issues

The SA team associated with each region will monitor the triage board and/or an associated Slack channel for incoming work and will contact the appropriate Customer Success team members via Slack, email or phone depending on required skills, schedules and availability. SLA for activity is 48 hours unless the issue is marked with an 'Expedite' label.

## SA Participation in Marketing Events

When technical staff is required for a marketing event, follow the process outlined on the [Marketing Events](/handbook/marketing/events/#requesting-technical-staffing) page. SA managers and others in Customer Success should monitor the [Event Staffing Board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/1254947) regularly for new events (although Marketing staff will CC the appropriate managers on issues.)

## Request Solutions Support from Product

When a prospect or customer have required capabilities that do not map directly to our product offering, Solutions Architectâ€™s first step is to explore solutions or work-arounds that would satisfy their requirements with our current toolset.
If the SA is unable to determine an approach that works for the prospect, the next best action is to reach out to the Product Manager. To determine what Product Manager is appropriate, review the [Product Categories handbook page](/handbook/product/categories/).

To be efficient as possible, this is the recommended approach:

1. **Gather**: Document and articulate the Customer journey
    1. Start by creating an issue on their [Account Management Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management). Include the customer business objectives, existing approach, and communication between the prospect (call recordings, emails, etc).
    1. Reference running logs in the [Customers & Prospects](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B-ytP5bMib9Ta25aSi13Q25GY1U) folder
1. **Explore**: If applicable, document the solutions or work-arounds that were explored with the customer and why that was not sufficient
1. **Engage**: Reach out to the Product Manager
    1. Create a new slack channel with SA/SAL/PM/etc with a link to the Account Management issue
    1. Be mindful and gift a minimum of 48-96 hr lead time.Â  _Properly done, PMs should have at least a weeks notice_
    1. Collaborate using the Account Management issue, history, running docs, and shared material
    1. [optional] Suggest an internal team call to coordinate materials and next steps
1. **Communicate**: Set up a call with the prospect or customer to determine the next best steps.
