## Channel Solutions Architecture Engagement Model

Engage a Channel SA when a GitLab Partner is involved in an opportunity and needs presales support, general enablement, or general practice building support.  We work closely with our Channel Account Managers (CAM) who own the business aspects of the partner relationship, and foster relationships at an opportunity level between GitLab Account Managers and the Partner Account teams.

Channel SA's ensure that partners get the most value possible out of their relationship with GitLab through their sales and delivery of GitLab's products and services. Channel Solutions Architects (CSA) organize their activities to mature GitLab partners quickly in their ability to deliver customer value.

To mature Partners through their Partner Journey, CSA's engage in a variety of activities designed to help Partners win deals, and mature their practices.  CSA activities can be seen as contributing to these themes, Align, Enable, and Expand partner value to customer success. The [partner maturity model](/handbook/customer-success/partners/vision/) has more details on the partner journey.
