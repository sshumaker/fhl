## Commercial Solutions Architecture Engagement Model

The Commercial SA Engagement Model intends to foster collaboration and influence and even greater iteration amongst ourselves and customers.

Given that Landed Addressable Market (LAM or LAM Dev) might not always be correct and the Opportunity Net ARR isn't always indicative of the potential, this model segments an SA team's engagement by the AE role, so that the SA engagement model is aligned with the AE team structures.  

Solutions architects are responsible for owning their engagement on opportunities. The "engagement model" is a general recommendation, not a rule, and will be left to the discretion of the solutions architect.

### SA Engagement Considerations

- Solutions Architects (SAs) help prospects and new customers that are wanting to buy and consume more of GitLab's offering.  CSMs and CSEs help customers adopt what customers have already purchased. 
- All requests for SAs are submitted via [Customer Success Triage Request Form](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/cs-triage-request/#/).
- Salesforce linked active opportunities should have [MEDDPPICC](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/meddppicc/) (and [required 7 methods applied](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/commercial/#required-7)).
- Compelling events are clearly defined in the Command Plan on an opportunity with a positive Net ARR.
- When SAs engage, their notes and activities are logged within Salesforce (review the [SA Activity Capture page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/solutions-architects/processes/activity-capture/)) and the [Customers & Prospects](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-ytP5bMib9Ta25aSi13Q25GY1U?resourcekey=0-MBirIe2vWyQXYi8cJEkH2Q&usp=sharing) Google Drive directory.

#### SA Engagement for Mid-Market

1. **Mid-Market First Order**: Early-stage `2-Scoping` through `4-Proposal` for opportunities where a Command Plan and Custom Pitch Deck are being leveraged where an SA is necessary. The goal is to complete the `3-Technical Evaluation` prior to 15 days of the Close Date.
1. **Mid-Market Named**: Opportunities (regardless of stage) where an SA is necessary through the course of the opportunity. The goal is to complete the `3-Technical Evaluation` prior to 30 days of the Close Date.
1. **Mid-Market Territory**: `3-Technical Evaluation` for opportunities where a Command Plan and Custom Pitch Deck are being leveraged and where an SA is necessary. The goal is to complete the `3-Technical Evaluation` prior to 30 days of the Close Date.

#### SA Engagement for SMB

1. **SMB First Order**: Late-stage `2-Scoping` and `3-Technical Evaluation` for opportunities where a Command Plan and Custom Pitch Deck are being leveraged where an SA is necessary. The goal is to complete the `3-Technical Evaluation` prior to 15 days of the Close Date.
1. **SMB Named**: Late-stage `2-Scoping` and `3-Technical Evaluation` for opportunities where a Command Plan and Custom Pitch Deck are being leveraged where an SA is necessary.  The goal is to complete the `3-Technical Evaluation` within 15 days of the Close Date.
1. **SMB First Year Expand**: AEs should rely on the CSM and CSEs as much as possible for First Year Expand opportunities given that the focus of a customer's first year is to adopt as much of what they have purchased as possible.  If a customer has demonstrable adoption of GitLab and is looking for more of GitLab's offering to use, then AEs ought to have the opportunity reviewed by their ASM prior to getting an SA engaged.
1. **SMB Pooled**: Requests ought to be brought forth by the AE and approved by the ASM and SA Manager to ensure that the need for an SA is justified.

#### Meeting Expectations

- All meetings should be planned with clear desired outcomes available to the SA
    - Why does the prospect want to meet with us?
    - What are our meeting objectives/goals?
    - Agenda and list of attendees should be provided in advance;<u>failure to provide this information could delay in the scheduling or declination of a meeting request.</u>
- SA activities include:
  - Discovery calls allow for pain to be identified and can be effective way to help build an awareness of the consequences of that pain both for the customer and the GitLab account team.
  - Demonstrations align value to capabilities within the product, aiming to speak to the needs of the customer. 
  - Technical Deep Dives are used to show off a very specific function or capability within GitLab's product.
  - Reverse AMAs where the SAs evaluate the customer environment and provide recommendations on ways to more effectively use GitLab.

#### Async Slack support

In some cases SA support might be required in early stage or not fully qualified opportunities. Slack can be used for answering technical questions, providing additional customer outreach materials or helping an Account Executive with a narrowly-scoped customer inquiry. These requests can be served asynchronously via Slack:
 - AMER: `#cs-commercial`
 - EMEA: `#cs-commercial-emea-sa-support`

These Slack channels are considered to be a safe harbor for all Commercial AE <-> SA communication. When asking questions, please ensure you provide as much context as possible; including the SFDC URL, and type of subscription (SaaS or Self-Managed). Solutions Architecture will monitor and provide best effort support on these requests.

#### Post-Sales Engagement

As an opportunity enters into either the [Negotiating or Awaiting Signature](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/#opportunity-stages) stage, the Solutions Architect and Account Executive ought to begin introducing the customer to a Customer Success Manager following the [Commercial CSM Transition Process](/handbook/customer-success/pre-sales-post-sales-transition/#commercial-csm-transition-process).

Solutions Architects ought to be primarily engaged with accounts that have active opportunities in Salesforce.  When we work with customers, it's easy to build a trusted advisor relationship with them that persists past the end of the sale.  In these cases, SAs must use their judgment in determining when to redirect a customer to the proper support channel for follow-up questions.

Below are a few example responses an SA can provide customers that reach out for help after a deal closes. Please leverage your personal connection to them and their company to customize these as you see fit.

##### Accounts without a Customer Success Manager

> Thanks for reaching out!
> 
> In order to best direct your question and provide you a timely response, can you submit a support ticket with our support team? Additionally, I have copied your Account Executive as they can help escalate your request if necessary. Below are some links to get started with GitLab support.
> 
> I thoroughly enjoyed getting a chance to work with you and role is primarily focused on our customers that are involved in pre-sales engagements; and being a person of one, I don't want to be a bottleneck to you getting a response.
> 
> You can go to [support.gitlab.com](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and submit a new request. Please use your company email address and an account and password will be created for you. There are more details regarding [reaching out to support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#first-time-reaching-suppor).

**Below are some additional items you can share with the customer.**

- Search GitLab documentation and issues with these pro [tips](/handbook/tools-and-tips/searching/)!
- If you do not find a proposed feature in the [GitLab issues list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues), please [contribute an idea](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed&issue[title]=Docs%20feedback%20-%20feature%20proposal:%20Write%20your%20title) to our product team to improve the community's experience!
- [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/) covering How-Tos for Installation and Day-to-Day usage.
- GitLab is fortunate enough to have a strong community of contributors where you can search for ideas and issues within the GitLab [Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) or moderated [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/).
- With transparency being a value of ours, we strive to push content daily to both the [GitLab Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg) and [GitLab Unfiltered Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A). You will find How-Tos and Daily Engineering conversations in these channels.

#### Other Considerations

##### Team meetings

- Team meetings are held on Mondays (Americas) at 10:30am PST for 25 minutes.
- Try to be respectful of our scheduled 1:1's meetings, though they can be more easily rescheduled in favor of customer engagement.

##### Meeting Follow up/Research

- Solutions Architects need time to provide follow up with information in as near real-time as possible. We aim to minimize scheduling “back-to-back” meetings as this can compromise our ability to provide our best possible response for the customers/prospects we're supporting.

## 5-Minute Demo Framework

The 5-Minute Demo Framework is a method to quickly produce technical content that is easy to consume for the customer. The intent of the framework is to rapidly develop tutorials while also generating value-packed content for the customer to consume. This content can range from videos, blog posts, or tutorials. As a result of building and sharing out bit-sized videos, the Commercial SA team can scale out our reach to a broader technical audience. Moreover, as the content compounds, the Account Executive teams will have a bank of content to share asynchronously to customers used to deliver value to customers efficiently.
