## Engage with an Architect
* TA's are available for Scoping Calls when an opportunity has been identified and discovery of the techinical challenges and an estimate of days required is unclear for the estimation templates. To inclue a TA in the conversation please use the conventions below. Please try to limit the unclusion of a TA to neccasary calls only.
  * For calls please tag `@ps-ta` in the `#ps-ta-ama` channel with the time proposed.
  * For Scoping issues add the label `Scoping::Needs_TA_Assistance` to the related GitLab issue with a clear ask in the comments for them to follow up on. (Scoping Information)[https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/engagement-mgmt/scoping-information/]
  * General questions can be asked in `#ps-ta-ama`. Any conversations that happen in this channel that need to be factored in for the SOW should be addded as a comment to the scoping issue.

## Aprovals
Any SOWs that have not had a TA involved in the scoping will need the `TA::Needs-Review` label added to the scoping issue to ensure we are reviewing it from a delivery standpoint. This does not include SKU's or standard migrations scoped with the estimate sheet. 

## Estimates
We are working on transitioning the original [Estimate Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YKMyflzsA-VPEVobB82zC8-n0hlC-uRBtiNB7Fm-kZg/edit#gid=674039849) to a new [Estimate Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSV_inLaN4tCIJ6jKkZFuHm7KGlfTHQ93LEY44okRIE/edit#gid=854215547). We will continue to add templates based off of the frequency we are engaging in esimates.
