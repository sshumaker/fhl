1. Click **Redeem and Create Account**.
1. The system will create a unique set of credentials for your training sandbox user. Either copy your credentials from **Your GitLab Credentials** and save them on your local computer, or click the **Download Credentials** button to download a text file containing your username and password. These credentials are not recoverable if you move past this page before saving them. A new sandbox account would have to be generated.

1. Log in using the username and password that were generated above.
