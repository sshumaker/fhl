#### Mavenlink Project Read/ Guest Access

With Guest Access, members can view information about a project without joining.
Mavenlink members would have the same access as their permission set without being a project participant.
However, they cannot comment, make changes, or interact with a project in any way. This is useful for managers or administrators who want to view project information and check progress without being seen.
Although similar, here are some differences between members with View Only project access and those with Guest Access:
- Members with View Only access appear as allocatable project resources. With Guest Access, members can view project information without appearing as an option to be scheduled or allocated on a project.
- Since they are not official project participants, guest viewers won't appear on the project as either the Provider or Client.
- Guests are not tied to Account-level permissions; therefore, if a member has Collaborator account permissions and is assigned Guest Access at the Project Financials level, this member will have have Project Financials view-only access.
- Instead of using the API or manually assigning View Only access to one team member at a time, Access Groups allows you to assign Guest Access in bulk.
Note: Members cannot be invited to a project as a guest viewer, they must be assigned Guest Access using Access Groups.
- A yellow notification banner at the top-right of the project indicates you are Viewing as Guest.

To view projects as Read only/ Guest:
- Members can find projects for which they have Guest Access by going to the Project List tab in Projects and selecting Guest Projects from the Show drop-down menu. Note that team members cannot have Guest Access on projects for which they're participating.

#### Mavenlink Time Off Scheduling, Holidays, Family and Friends Days

****Regional Holidays and Family and Friends Days****

Regional holidays and Family and Friends days are included in Mavenlink on each members calendar, followed by the  [time off process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off).  Since the days are included in the calendar there is no need to submit the time in the Mavenlink PTO feature or the users time sheet.  When logging into the time sheet, the required work week is shown on the time sheet entry.

![TimeOff](./Timeoff.png)

GitLab company policy to submit time off is through PTO by Deel, and followed by this [handbook process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/).
In the Professional Services group, we also require time off to be submitted to Mavenlink:

Benefits of having time off in Mavenlink
- Time is includes on our Master Planning scheduling calendar
- This allows the PC and project managers to plan customer project around time off
- Ensures there is no conflicting customer project schedules

Process:

- When time-off is submitted to PTO by Deel, time-off is required to be submitted in Mavenlink as well.
- Review the Master Planning to be sure a project is not already scheduled during the desired time off
- If project time is scheduled, review with the Project Coordinator if the project time could be moved or come to a mutual agreement for the requested time off  

Time off would be submitted from the Dashboard, by clicking on the profile picture:
- GO to "Your Dashboard"
- Click on "Your Profile Picture"
- Right hand profile will pop up, there is a section for Upcoming Time Off
- Click on the plus sign to add time off

Time off cancellation
- GO to "Your Dashboard"
- Click on "Your Profile Picture"
- Right hand profile will pop up, there is a section for Upcoming Time Off
- Click on the plus sign select the date and update the hours to "0"

#### Mavenlink Time Tracking- Time Sheets

![tmesheets](./tmesheets.png)

#### Mavenlink Time Approval Process

Overview

With Mavenlink’s time approval functionality, members with Project Lead account permissions (or higher) can access the Time Approvals page where they can view and manage time for all projects in which they have Financials permissions (or higher).

The Time Approvals page allows you to view Submitted, Unsubmitted, and Rejected time entries from tabs with the corresponding names. Depending on the state of the submission, you can view the timesheet, private message a user who submitted time, and either approve or reject the time entry. You can also directly message those who still needs to submit time, reminding them to do so.

If you have Report Viewer account permissions (or higher)—or have been designated as a Time Approver for an individual member or project—you’ll see the Your Approvals check box. You can select this checkbox to only see the time that you’re responsible for approving; otherwise, deselect it to review and take action on all submissions.

Members that do not have account permission of Report Viewer (or higher) will only be able to approve time in the project's Activity Feed.
