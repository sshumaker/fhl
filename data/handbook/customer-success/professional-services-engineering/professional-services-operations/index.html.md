## Project Coordination- Consulting

#### Consulting Project Scheduling

[Lead Time for Professional Services Engagement](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/working-with/#lead-time-for-starting-a-professional-services-engagement)

[The PS Opportunity has closed, whats next](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/working-with/#scheduling-professional-services)

If project work is required to start the project prior to the opportunity booking, then the [Work At Risk Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/project-mgmt/#work-at-risk) would need to be followed and approved.

#### Customer Consulting Project Scheduling

The consulting operations team has a [board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/boards/3487648?label_name[]=pc-consulting-checklist) to track the scheduling progress of the consulting projects.  There is a [checklist](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/pc-consulting-checklist.md) that is utilized to track the progress of each project as we work through Kantata project set up, project team assignment and partner paperwork. There is also a [Project Scheduling Intake Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SchedulingPreparation.md) in which we request information pertinent to the scheduling process.

#### Scheduling Request for Consulting Projects

We do understand we may have circumstances to plan for a project before a SF Stage 5, but we would like to have most of the information met prior to contacting PS Operations.  

| Action |DRI |
| ------ | ------ |
| SF Opportunity is at least a stage 5 | Opportunity Owner |
| Forecast category is Commit | Opportunity Owner |
| Customer has agreed to the SOW | Opportunity Owner |
| PS Quote has been created on the opportunity | Opportunity Owner |
| Executed MSA/PSA | Opportunity Owner |
| Agreed close plan with the customer | Opportunity Owner |
| Skills pushed to the Customer Epic | Assigned Engagement Manager |
| [Project Scheduling Intake Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SchedulingPreparation.md) populated with required details | Assigned Engagement Manager |

For staffing requirements or questions, add the details to the Project Scheduling Intake Issue and tag the assigned Project Coordinator.  If there is not a Project Coordinator assigned, tag the Operations Manager for assistance and assignment will be completed at that time. Moving forward, the Project Scheduling Intake Issue will house all information and discussions regarding scheduling. The PC Checklist will only be used internally by the Project Coordinator.

##### Internal Project Scheduling

If a Team Member would like to have time blocked on their schedule to allow time for non-customer project related items, certifications, or ramp up,
a request should be submitted via a comment and tag the PC on either Internal Projects:

- PS Time Tracking Creditable
- PS Time Tracking Non-Creditable

Comment should be added to the activity page to include the following:
- Task
- Time Required
- Priority Level

The PC will review availablity and schedule the time on the Master Planning with an allocation.

#### Consulting Project Assignment

When the PC and PM have the project team aligned the PC will send [Consulting Project Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HfIt30ksOlhv3zAxh8ZPX-5J59maiuhNgZT2E5lMpsk/edit) in the Kantata project activity, this allows the team to be aware of who will be working on the project.

#### Consulting Projects Billing Guidelines

Project billing is outlined in each customer SOW or Order Form.  The current billing terms that Professional Services follows is the following:
   * Billed upon SOW execution
   * Order Form execution
   * Time and Materials
   * Project miletone 
   * Billed half up front and half at project completion
   * Billed at completion
   
Passive acceptance of 5 days is included in the SOW unless different terms are negotiated by the customer and approved by the Director of Professional Services.
   
#### Consulting Projects Revenue Forecasting Guidelines

Project revenue release is followed dependant on project billing type:
   * Billed upon SOW execution billing terms
     * SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
   * Billed upon Order Form execution billing terms
     * SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
   * Time and Materials billing terms
     * Approved time sheet hours reported at each month end 
   * Project milestone SOW billing terms
     * SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
   * Billed half up front and half at project completion SOW billing terms
     * SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached
   * Billed at completion billing terms
     * SOW contains milestones that include activities, and revenue can be released as each milestone is                 accepted or passive acceptance is reached

#### How To Forecast Revenue For Consulting Projects

##### T&M Projects
T&M project revenue is forecasted by scheduled soft or hard allocations in the Master Planning in Kantata.  The hours that are schedule are multiplied by the rate card on the project.  

##### Fixed Priced Projects

Fixed priced projects are forecasted by the project milestones in the Kantata project.  Each milestone has a sign off task, that task is updated with correct sign off date for the activities in the milestone.  Best practice is update the sign off task to give time for the customer to review and obtain acceptance from the customer.
If there is not confidence that the activities will be complete and the customer will sign off, then the Sign Off task should be moved out to the next quarter.

#### Revenue Sign Off

##### Revenue Release T&M Projects

For T&M projects, revenue is released at each month end. Project hours are submitted weekly via the time sheet function in Kantata. The PSE or PM submits time against the project, and the Project PM or Lead approves on a weekly basis. Each month end, the PC pulls a report of all approved time sheets and provides the consolidated report to Finance to review and release the revenue.

##### Revenue Release FP Projects

For FP projects, revenue is released when customer acceptance is received or passive acceptance has passed as it pertains to the project SOW language.
The PM sends out the request for acceptance to the customer and then updates the Billing/ Revenue Milestone in Kantata.  When sending out the acceptance email, the PM should copy the Operations Manager and the assigned Project Coordinator.  When counting the passive acceptance days, day 1 would be the date the notification is sent, from the date sent then business days is calculated for the passive acceptance.
*  Update Sign Off Sent, when email request is sent
*  Update Sign Off received, when acceptance is received or Passive Acceptance is reached and add the PDF email of acceptance to the Milestone
*  Update if Passive Acceptance has been utilized for sign off

## Project Coordination- Training

#### Training Planning and Scheduling

Refer to this [internal page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ps-leadership-team/ps-operations/-/wikis/home#calendar_spiral-training-operations) for more information.

___

#### Training Projects Billing Guidelines

Training billing is outlined in each customer SOW or Order Form.  The current billing terms that Professional Services follows is the following:
   * Billed upon SOW
   * Order Form execution
   
Passive acceptance of 5 days is included in the SOW unless different terms are negotiated by the customer and approved by the Director of Professional Services.

#### Training Projects Revenue Forecasting Guidelines

Training revenue release is followed dependant on training billing type:
   * Billed upon SOW 
     * Once each training class is complete and roster is received
   * Order Form execution billing terms
     * Once each training class is complete and roster is received

#### How To Forecast Revenue Training Projects

Training projects are typically considered fixed priced projects and are forecasted by the project milestones in the Kantata project.  Each milestone includes tasks for each training course that are used to capture training preparation/planning/closeout and delivery hours.  Each task is updated with the correct due date for the activities in the milestone.  Best practice is to ensure that the task due dates are updated to accurately reflect training completion dates for forecasting purposes.  
If there is not confidence that the activities will be complete, then the task due date should be moved out to the next quarter.

#### Revenue Release Training Projects

For training projects, revenue is released when training is complete and/or when acceptance is received dependant on the project SOW language.
If required per the project SOW, the PC sends the request for acceptance to the customer and then updates the Billing/ Revenue Milestone in Kantata
*  Update Sign Off Sent, when training is complete or email request is sent
*  Update Sign Off received, when training is complete, acceptance is received, or Passive Acceptance is reached and add the class roster or PDF email of acceptance to the Milestone
*  Update if Passive Acceptance has been utilized for sign off

#### Time Tracking 

Accurate time tracking records of hours is essential to ensure revenue can be recognized based upon percentage completion of a project scope as outlined in a Statement of Work ("SOW"), and this data is used in the calculation of gross margin. Key points for time tracking include:

- Best practice is to record time at the end of each day. This provides the most accurate account of hours worked and when it was worked
- Each PSE is required and responsible for tracking their own hours, and submitted weekly by Friday EOD for the week worked
- If time will be worked over the weekend, time sheet should still be submitted by Friday, EOD, then a new line created on the time sheet for hours worked over the weekend
- Billable hours represent work hours that a staff member reports as being aligned to a specific SOW. The format for daily time tracking for each team member is shown below, and is reviewed weekly by PS Operations and Manager
- Hours for PTO, Holidays and Family and Friends day are no longer required to be submitted in the weekly time sheet
- If a team member did not work the time allocated for the week, then hours would be added to the PTO feature in Kantata
- Notes are required for the PS Time Tracking Creditable and PS Time Tracking Non Credit projects only, not on customer projects
  
  - PTO should be submitted in the time off feature in Kantata, and also follow the company guidelines, [time off process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off)
  - Holidays along with Family and Friends day are scheduled on the Kantata calendar
  
- Time is required to round to the nearest quarter hour, example: 
  - 15m should be .25
  - 30m should be .5
  - 45m should be .75

****Kantata Internal Projects****

Internal projects are set up to track internal time that is not customer project related. Below is the project name along with tasks and examples.

* [PS Time Tracking Creditable](https://gitlab.mavenlink.com/workspaces/34595705/tracker/position?usingDefaultFilters=true&mode=info)
* [PS Time Tracking Non- Creditable](https://gitlab.mavenlink.com/workspaces/34595955/?tab=project-workspace)
   
****Customer consulting projects****

  When working on a customer project, all hours worked should be tracked against the project.  Here are some examples: 
  * Project tasks are aligned with SOW activities and hours tracked against the tasks
  * Internal/ Sales Handoff Calls
  * Internal/ External status meeting
  * Support ticket submission while the project is in progress
  * Weekly/ Final customer reports and documentation
  * Status/ Close out customer calls
  * Customer Travel

****Customer training projects****
 
  When working on a training project, all hours worked should be tracked against the project.  Here are some examples:
  * Introduction/ Planning/ Preparation/ Close Out
    * All hours should be tracked against the task for preparation and close out of the training
  * All class hours are to be tracked against the task that gives the name of the training, example is GitLab Basics TRNG Hours

#### Month End Time Tracking Guidelines

Professional Services has a hard close at each month end.

Our agreed schedule with finance is [Monthly/ Quarterly/ Year End Time Lines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15uTHHnmIvWteYGi98BaikOVDtN99MLiVN9su-YlMMLM/edit#gid=0)

   * By Noon ET, Time Sheets will need to be submitted on -3 working day from the last business day of the month
     * Time would include hours for that day along with an estimate of hours for the final 2 business days of the month
     * If corrections need to be made for the final 3 days of the month, that would be included in the following weeks time sheet
   * By 2PM ET, Time Sheets will need to be approved by the Project Managers and Coordinators on -3 working day from the last business day of the month
   * By 6 PM ET, the Operations Manager will have gone through the review process and submit reporting to Finance on -3 working day from the last business day of the month

Here is a link of an overview of the [December Process](https://www.loom.com/share/28eea56141164bca8865112f255d48fa?sharedAppSource=personal_library)


Time sheets would be submitted by the team and then approved by the project lead on the cutoff date.  Then an additional project line would be added to finish out the remainder of the week, and follow the normal end of the week process.

Here is an example of a time sheet that has been submitted and approved on a Tuesday, then new lines created for the remainder of the week

![splittimesheet](./splittimesheet.png)

#### Month End Revenue and Billing Timelines

Our agreed schedule with finance is [Monthly/ Quarterly/ Year End Time Lines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15uTHHnmIvWteYGi98BaikOVDtN99MLiVN9su-YlMMLM/edit#gid=0)

All timesheets and fixed priced items will be signed off and completed on the monthly and quarterly deadline, then timesheets approvals and reports are submitted the following day.

There is an agreement with revenue if FP items over $10,000 process after the cutoff date and prior to month end, and the billing is complete then the revenue can be processed and accounted for the current month.

#### Quarterly time tracking entry and approval workflow

* All hours are submitted and approved in Kantata on a weekly basis
* The quarterly hours report is pulled from Kantata and reviewed by the Operations Manager and then provided to the PS Director for review and approval
* A PS Director will APPROVE the hours, create an issue and attach it to the Time Tracking Epic with the `ManagerCertifiedTimesheet` label
* The approving manager will submit to the Head of PS, [Sr. Director of Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/sales/director-of-professional-services/) for next level approval.  The Head of PS with apply judgement on productive utilization.
* Head of Professional Services will submit to the Professional Services Finance Partner for final approval.

### Project Expenses
GitLab Employee Travels:

Before making a purchase of any type or booking travel for a customer project, be sure to obtain approval from your Project Manager or Project Coordinator.

#### Making Engagement Epic and Issues Partner Accessible
##### Background
* [PS automation](https://gitlab.com/services-calculator/services-calculator.gitlab.io) creates engagement epics in [Professional-Services-Group](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/-/epics) and issues in [PS-Plan](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/ps-plan/-/issues).
* It's useful to move the epics of engagements that require partner access to [Professional-Servies-Group > Consulting Delivery](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/-/epics)

##### Notes
* Epics can not currently be moved so instead we recreate the epic in the new location, move the subordinate issues to the new location and close the original epic as described in _Directions_ below.
* The original and new epics are linked via their issue move audit entries.
* The directions do not use a [bulk edit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#bulk-edit-issues-from-a-project) due to [this epic search issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233729).

##### Directions
* Open the to-be-recreated epic in a browser tab
* Open the [destination epics list UI](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/professional-services-group/ww-consulting/-/epics) in another browser tab
  * _New Epic_
    * Title - `Customer Name` Customer Project Epic
    * Description - copy and paste description markdown from the original epic (current in the other browser tab)
    * _Create epic_
  * Put the url of the new epic in the copy paste buffer for use below
* For each issue in the to-be-recreated epic:
