## Where to position PS in the Customer Journey
Most professional service engagements happen during the onboarding, implementation, and adoption phases of the [customer journey](/handbook/customer-success/vision/).

![GitLab Customer Journey](/handbook/customer-success/vision/images/customer-journey.jpeg "GitLab Customer Journey")

When opportunities are approaching closed/won and planning for these stages is occurring, its a good idea to consider bringing in professional services to help expedite the customer's transition to using gitlab to enable them to [realize value faster](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis).

This page aims to help the ISR/SAL understand the services that certain types of customers typically engage in and how to position those services when building out a success plan.

## Value of GitLab Professional Services
![Professional Services Value](./ps-value.png)

<!-- ### Elevator Pitch

**The Problem - Customer Perspective**

The customer has decided that GitLab is their tool of choice going forward, but has concerns about realizing the value of GitLab quickly and seamlessly.  These concerns can be in various areas:

* Lack of subject matter expertise on the GitLab technology stack
* Lack of adequate resources to promptly stand up GitLab
* Lack of sufficient resources to stand up GitLab in a highly-available or geographically dispersed way
* Concern around a large number of users coming off of legacy systems
* Concerns about change management for new processes
* Lack of confidence in the ability to deliver on the transformative promise of adopting "all" of GitLab

**Solution** -->

### Single Sentence

With PS engagement, customers start leveraging the full capabilities of GitLab earlier with improved proficiency, reduced risk, and increased competitive advantage.

## Customer Archetypes

### Mid-Market to Enterprise coming from non-gitlab SCM

These customers are adopting gitlab usually for a number of reasons, but typically use SCM as their entry point. They have source code management happening in their company but it might not be standardized into a single process or tool. This means they will need to migrate data and users to (sometimes git and) gitlab.

The larger the company, the higher likelihood they will be opting for gitlab self-managed. If this is the case, they will need to deploy gitlab typically with aspirational requirements of system High Availability, Disaster Recovery and performance and might not have the technical expertise in their current staff.

They have a team that manages the current tooling at the highest level, and are often competing against shadow IT from setting up their own (less restrictive) instances of SDLC tools. This team has probably never managed a large migration and needs help with the rollout plan. Their engineering teams (end users of gitlab) are on the continuum of knowledge about latest git and gitlab best practices.

To get to [first value](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis) as soon as possible, you should consider:
 - [Implementation](/services/implementation/) (infrastructure deployment and gitlab configuration)
 - [Migration](/services/migration/) (SCM Data and user migration)
 - [Education](/services/education/) (Basics, CI/CD and Admin)

### SMB to Mid-Market moving to gitlab.com

These customers typically move to gitlab for the benefits of an all-in-one SDLC platform to reduce toolchain tax.

They will likely have a small team responsible for transformation that will be managing this transition. Its unlikely they have the expertise or time to manage a data and user migration without slowing down their business significantly. They will also probably want to integrate with other systems like LDAP, Jira, or Jenkins. Finally, their users will probably need upskilling on the basic and advanced features of gitlab to ensure they're getting the most value out of the gitlab.

To get your customer the most [value](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#time-to-value-kpis) as soon as possible, you should consider:
 - [Migration](/services/migration/) (SCM and/or CI/CD based on entry point)
 - [Integration](/services/implementation/integration/) (LDAP/SSO, Jira, Jenkins)
 - [Education](/services/education/) (Basics and/or CI/CD)

### SMB or Mid-Market without migration needs
Some customers have a team of git ninjas who can manage migration and setup quickly, but the rest of the engineers might not be as skilled. Its always a good idea to suggest education services because the customer end users will be more likely to push for later stage adoption. This type of grassroots motivation will go a long way when investigating conversion opportunities.

For these customers consider our [Education Services](/services/education/) (Basics, CI/CD, Devops Fundamentals)
