## Overview

One of the tools CSMs have to speed customer onboarding, increase user adoption, and drive stage adoption is to offer their customers Workshops and/or Lunch-and-Learns (generically referred to as sessions). 

## Frequency

The CSM should offer sessions during onboarding so the customer is aware that they are available and the list of typical sessions that can be done.  Additionally, the CSM should offer a specific session when working with a customer on a stage enablement. The customer collaboration project now has a default issue that has the list of current offerings with a brief description.

Sessions should be [captured in Gainsight](/handbook/customer-success/csm/gainsight/timeline/#how-to-log-activities-in-timeline), which [drives the Engagement scorecard metric](/handbook/customer-success/csm/health-score-triage/#gainsight-scorecard-attributes-and-calculations).  Record the date and type of session it was as well as an approximate number of attendees.

## Type of sessions

There are two main types of sessions that can be offered.  Workshops are generally 1.5-2 hours and include the presentation, demo, and Q&A. These require more preparation and planning and are usually organized by the CSM in collaboration with other CSMs and SAs.

Enablement sessions are generally 1 hour and involve presentation, demo, and Q&A and are usually given by the CSM themselves.

If you have additional sessions you want to contribute, please follow these instructions:
- Save the template deck to the [Lunch and Learns Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnDsqoc-KRdy7hF1jbo6H_59FwzpiKUc) (eventually these will move to Highspot as our single source of truth)
- Update this handbook page to include the name of the session, intended audience, and a summary of the content/goals
- Update the [collaboration project template issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/templates/customer-collaboration-project-template/-/issues/44) to include the same

If you are interested in a session that doesn't exist yet, but you're not able or comfortable creating it, please post a message in [#tim-tams](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/G8F1W2AGM) about what you would like to see!

### Offering the session

CSMs should offer sessions early during onboarding, and whenever working on a stage enablement. If the customer wants a session on a topic we do not already have slides for, request more time to prepare, and then work with the Customer Success team to help pull together some slides for the session. Then the newly created session can be added to the list of existing sessions available to other CSMs.

It is recommended to invite another GitLab team member to the session to help with notes, audience management, and Q&A. This helper could be the Solutions Architect or Strategic Account Leader for the account, or it could be a fellow CSM.

Consider the typical length of the session when scheduling. It is recommended to coordinate with your champion on the following information:

- Who is hosting the session
- Will it be recorded
- Who is kicking it off

It is highly recommended to have someone from your regular cadence calls on the session, as some questions asked during the session may be specific to their instance configuration and they will need to answer those questions.

### Preparation for the session

The CSM should review the available content for [Workshops](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qAymFTiXFEk-lRSNreIhaZ6Z62fdo_y2) and [Lunch-and-Learns](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnDsqoc-KRdy7hF1jbo6H_59FwzpiKUc) for the topic requested. CSMs can use the content as-is if they feel it will meet their needs or they can make a copy of the slides and customize it for their customer's needs.

CSMs should review the speaker notes to ensure they understand each slide, and add clarifications and notes to them as needed. Ensure you have a plan for what you want to communicate for each slide, but don't try to memorize what you are going to say.

Recordings of sessions that CSMs have previously run can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11LeQbvUBwdqqWMplSb4iUTlxm7e7uXtD?usp=share_link) and may also be helpful to review as part of the preparation process.

### Conducting the session

Have your champion introduce you if possible. Use Presenter View in Google Slides to have the speaker notes available in a separate window. Run your slides off of your smaller monitor or on your MacBook screen if possible so the screen resolution is not an issue for participants with lower resolutions.

Introduce yourself and make sure you set ground rules if your champion did not.

For smaller groups (40), you can offer to allow them to come off mute to ask their questions.

For larger groups, it is recommended they put their questions in chat so you can address them at the appropriate time. It is recommended to pause periodically to take questions and also to ensure you stay hydrated during the session.

If you get lost or forget what to say, refer to your speaker notes. It is OK to read directly from them until you get back on track.  Feel free to reference other sessions that may cover a topic in more detail, even if you don't have that session planned, as this can generate demand for those sessions and lead to further user adoption and stage enablements. Also, if your customer is on Premium, don't shy away from mentioning Ultimate features during your presentation.

When you do pause for questions, try to answer them but it is OK to say you don't know and will research it and get the answer back to your champion. It is also OK if the question is answered in more detail in another session to simply refer to that session instead of taking too much time during the current one. It is not advised to give out your direct contact information to the audience and instead have them direct future questions to your champion.

### After the session

Send a copy of the slides used, and a link to the recording to your champion so they can share it with the participants and with those that could not attend the live session. Follow up on any question that could not be answered. Add a follow-up item to your next cadence call agenda to see what they thought went well and what could be improved for future sessions. Work to schedule other sessions based on demand.

## Session Notes

Similar to taking notes in a cadence call, it is useful to add to your running notes doc in each enablement session you run for the customer. Include a list of attendees, max participant count, record of questions and answers provided, and any follow-up items that were not addressed during the session

### Best Practices for Note-Taking

- Write down your _agenda_ (including questions you want to ask). This way you can quickly add your notes for the specific context.
- If you're comfortable writing in [Markdown format](/handbook/markdown-guide/), use it to quickly structure your notes in real time.
- Allow yourself time directly after the call to clean up your notes. Avoid scheduling back-to-back meetings.
- Practice slowing down call conversations. Stopping the dialog for a few seconds to say “let me write that down” tells the customer what they said is important to you.
- Ask your SAL/AE/SA to take notes with you. After the meeting combine and add detail.
- Use [Chorus](/handbook/business-technology/tech-stack/#chorus) to record your calls so there's less pressure for you to take note of everything.
- Sometimes it makes sense for somebody on the [account team](/handbook/customer-success/account-team/) to go back through the call in Chorus to transcribe it.
- Write notes in whatever is easiest and always copy them to your best source of truth. If you can write them in the source of truth in the first place, you’ll be more efficient and consistent.
