## Digital Programs

Programs are developed using input from CSMs, customers, and other GitLab resources. Our goal is to provide customers with useful ways to serve themselves. We provide the following:

- Onboarding resources for customers
- Survey results
- Stage enablement email series
- Newsletters
- Webinar setup and insight
- Education, best practices, and planning resources for customers and GitLab team members
- Gainsight playbook setup and maintenance

For more information about Customer Programs, including how to request new or contribute to existing programs, or add contacts to Gainsight, see the [Customer Programs page](/handbook/sales/field-operations/customer-success-operations/cs-ops-programs/).

## Onboarding resources

The Onboarding Quick Guide project template will allow customers to self-service the materials provided from the email templates. The following video provides an overview of how to use the Onboarding Quick Guide project template.<br><br>
