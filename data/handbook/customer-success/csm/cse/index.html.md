## CSE Vision
To be the world's most customer-centric company, where customers can accelerate their own missions with frictionless adoption and value realisation of The One DevOps Platform.

## CSE Mission
The Customer Success Engineer (CSE) provides deep subject matter expertise on GitLab technical and product solutions and best practices in order to drive measurable value for GitLab customers.  CSEs work alongside CSMs to provide customers with technical guidance, go in-depth on use case implementation, and demonstrate the value of GitLab product capabilities, leading to product adoption, expansion, and greater value realized by our customers.

1. Establish the core team
2. Define and document role and responsibilities

## Role & Responsibilities
Engage with customers in a technical consultancy and advisor role during their GitLab Journey while providing technical and solution guidance. This is achieved by driving towards measurable value (business outcomes), leading to product adoption, renewal, and expansion opportunities. The team is focused on solution-based programs that are customized to fit an individual customer's needs. 

## GitLab Use Cases supported by CSEs

- Infrastructure Discovery (initial exploration on direction, complexity)
- Hands-on workshops to drive adoption
- CSM Office Hours, enablement

## Deliverables & Scope per Use Case
- CSE is working on a fixed (time), scoped (deliverables) engagement with a dedicated area/business unit/team (aligned) within an existing customer.
- CSE engagement is supporting adoption and growth within a GitLab Use Case.
- Deliverables are defined upfront and mutually agreed between Customer, CSM, CSE, SA.
- Deliverables are templated, success metrics can vary based on customer situation.
- Results and adoption patterns are documented in the handbook or Docs.

## Engagement Model

### Engagement Request

**DRI: CSM**

When involving a CSE in a customer's adoption journey or other technical implementation effort, some initial details are needed to scope the engagement:

1. **Objective in the success plan:** link directly to the objective within the customer's [success plan](/handbook/customer-success/csm/success-plans/) (this link is available under the "three-dot" menu on the objective within Gainsight)
   1. **Expected effort:** Captured within the objective in Gainsight; Will the CSE be engaged for a one-off event, or for a longer period of time (e.g. one to multiple weeks)? If longer, what is the expected duration? _Examples of different engagements & accompanying scope include:_ 
      1. Hands-on demo: if this is the entirety of the engagement this would be a one-off; if this is a piece of a larger engagement plan then the scope would be longer
      1. Use case adoption enablement campaign: the CSE will engage with the customer in several ways to enable user groups on the usage of a given GitLab use case. This would be a longer term engagement.
   1. **Target start date:** what is the expected start date for the CSE engagement? _Please be as specific as possible, but if there isn't an exact date provide a general time frame (e.g. first week of May)_
   1. **Outcome & success criteria:** what will we, and the customer, need to achieve in order for the engagement to be successful? What metrics & deliverables have we agreed on?
   1. **Stakeholders & contacts:** who from the customer is involved, and what is their role? _Please provide each person's name and role/title, as well as a brief summary of their responsibilities during the engagement._
1. **Create CSE engagement request issue:** [Issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/customer-success-engineering/-/issues/new?issuable_template=cse-engagement-request)

### Request Review and Approval

**DRI: CSE Manager**

Once a CSE engagement request is submitted, the CSE manager will review the request. They will respond with any clarifying questions, and determine CSE availability (Capacity planning).
