## Gainsight dashboard

When logging in, CSMs will begin on their dashboard. Gainsight's homepage will show a "CSM Portfolio" Dashboard which is a full list and overview of each CSM's customers. This dashboard defaults to show the book of business for the current user but can be filtered and configured in a variety of ways to view the information for specific CSMs, teams, etc.

This dashboard is likely to be a CSM's most-frequented page, as it shows a summary of their entire book of business, including last activity dates, health scores, at-risk customers, [upcoming renewals](/handbook/customer-success/csm/renewals/), stage adoption statistics, success plan progress, and more.

There are also other dashboards available to CSMs to look at, including the CS Leadership Dashboard which reviews aspects of all CSM-supported accounts, the Customer Onboarding Dashboard which shows the status of onboarding across all accounts, and the Stage Adoption Dashboard which goes into detail regarding which stages have been adopted and the success of adoption plays.

If there is an asterisk (*) in the title of a report, widget, or field, that means it takes up to 24 hours for that data to update if you change it. For example, in the CSM Burndown Dashboard, there's a widget called `*PR1 Cadence >30 Days`, which shows how many Priority 1 accounts have not had a cadence call recorded in more than 30 days. If you then record a call in Timeline, it will take up to 24 hours for that widget to reflect the updated information.  

When hovering on the far left of the screen, a sidebar will pop up that has a few options:

- Home - you're here!
- Timeline - this [Timeline](/handbook/customer-success/csm/gainsight/timeline/#timeline-view) view shows all customers, rather than an individual customer which can be found on a [Customer 360](/handbook/customer-success/csm/gainsight/#customer-360).
- Cockpit - the Cockpit is where [CTAs](/handbook/customer-success/csm/gainsight/ctas/) live; this Cockpit view shows all CTAs for all of your customers, including success plan objectives.
