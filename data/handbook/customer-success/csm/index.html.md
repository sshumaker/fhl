## Mission Statement

Aligning passionate CSMs with customers to ensure their success by...  
- Driving progress aligned with their business outcomes
- Identifying and enabling the customer in their current and future GitLab use cases
- Expanding ROI with GitLab  

## What is a Customer Success Manager (CSM) at GitLab?

CSMs are accountable for customer adoption, measurable outcomes, customer satisfaction, and creating true customer advocacy. We create successful customers by enabling, training, and nurturing them throughout their journey. The following areas incorporate the remit of a CSM: 

- **Customer Adoption -**  Ensure the customer is working towards or adopting their desired use cases to maturity. Ensure the successful onboarding of all intended users. Identify areas of adoption risk and establish mitigating plays and programs. 
- **Delivering Positive Business Outcomes -** Ensure customers are meeting and exceeding their desired business outcomes so that customers can quantify and support their investment.
- **Trusted Advisor -** Establish "trusted advisor" relationships with the management and technical teams on the customer side while working seamlessly with our account team to deliver a best-in-class customer experience.
- **Account Expansion -** Lead adoption expansion beyond the customer's desired use cases and further customer return on investment (ROI). Partner with Sales to identify expansion opportunities and ensure we realize the expansion potential of a customer account.
- **Leading Business Reviews -**  Review and celebrate progress towards, or achievement of, the customer's desired business outcomes. Address challenges with a plan for mitigation, align on upcoming and future customer business objectives.

## FY24 Annual OKRs (Big Rocks)

**Objective:**  The 3 ‘big rocks’ to take on in FY24 with the overall goal of moving our team forwards. These rocks need to move us forwards as a team and as individuals, enabling us to scale, be impactful, and be inspired/fulfilled in our roles. 

**What are 'big rocks'?** As outlined in [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hillennevins/2020/01/21/what-are-your-big-rocks/?sh=191f218fae34), they are our priorities, our mission-critical objectives that we need to solve for in the coming year. We arrived at this list through CSM leadership discussions and final input from individual contributors.

### Big Rock 1: Invest in the team to drive customer value

Investing in the CSM team is a top priority, and this year we will provide team members with education and enablement to empower them in their role with customers and other GitLab team members, specifically related to:
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Executive engagement
- Sales approach best practices
- Book of business ownership

CSMs will exit FY24 with skills to help them throughout their career, and they will be better equipped to drive customer results and ROI, through improved confidence, leadership, collaboration, and ownership.

Our goals with this big rock include the following initiatives:
- Develop and launch enablement materials for skills key to being a successful CSM:
   - Neurodiversity awareness
   - Cross-departmental collaboration
   - Executive engagement and presence
   - Sales expertise
   - Strategic long-term planning
- Close gaps across CSM and Sales ICs and managers by establishing regular cadences and documenting agreed-upon expectations
- Invest in CSMs' personal and professional development through provided training, growth & development budget, and regular growth conversations
- Ensure fundamentals learned in onboarding are regularly reinforced with all members of the team
- Foster an inclusive environment for CSMs and elevate diversity as a core value

For more information and specifics, please review the [epic for Big Rock 1](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/epics/97) (GitLab-internal only), which includes quarterly OKRs for FY24.


### Big Rock 2: Drive product adoption and growth for your customers

[Epic for Big Rock 2](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/epics/95)

Equip team members to speak to product capabilities, value propositions, business impact, and help customers with use case adoption.

### Big Rock 3: Know our customers 

[Epic for Big Rock 3](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/customer-success/-/epics/96) (GitLab-internal only)


Position CSMs to identify opportunity & risk through excellent account management practices. To ascend beyond transactional Q&A, and build relationships as a trusted advisor.

The [education and enablement handbook page](/handbook/customer-success/education-enablement) provides a dashboard of aggregated resources that we encourage you to use to get up to speed.

## SFDC useful reports 

### Tracking opportunities for your assigned Strategic Account Leader (SALs)

To ensure that opportunities are listed with the correct Order Type, [this Salesforce report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) shows you all of the opportunities that have closed, or are soon to close, with your SALs. Tracking Order Type is important since CSM team quota and compensation depend on this. Please reference the latest [Sales Compensation Plan](/handbook/finance/sales-comp-plan/) information to know what is counted.

Next steps for you:

1. Customize [this SFDC report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004agfP) where “Account Owner = your SALs”; “CSM = You”
1. Save report
1. Subscribe to report when “Record Count Greater Than 0” and Frequency = Weekly (You’ll get a weekly email as a reminder to look at the report)
1. If you find an opp that is tagged incorrectly, chatter (@Sales-Support) in the opportunity and let them know there is a mistake ([example](/handbook/customer-success/csm/#csm-tools))
