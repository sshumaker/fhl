## Working with us
**Purpose**: outline how the broader Self-Service team can engage the Self-Service Data Squad (Max, Sara)

**Goal**: minimize dependencies/blockers to insights while providing transparent engagement model

**Disclaimer**: Not all data questions will be able to be answered. Ultimately, taking time to answer ad-hoc questions means less time on projects (aka the zero-sum capacity problem). That is not to say that ad-hoc questions are not important; however, we do have “boulder” level projects in flight have been prioritized via the OKR process, which we also need to make progress on.

**How to submit your ad-hoc data request or question**:

1. Have you tried to answer this question leveraging existing resources (e.g. data hub, SFDC)?

- If no, please try to answer your question using these existing resources.
- If yes, but you’re still unable to answer your question, go to question 2.

2. Using the Data Question Intake issue template in [our project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/self-service/), please:

- Fill out all items under the “Filled out by Requestor” section
- Add the “Self-Service Data” and “Self-Service Data Ad Hoc” labels
- If business stopping: tag Max in Slack (ideally in [self-service_public](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C02F6JUKF6X)) with link to issue.

## How we prioritize ad hoc requests
The more points the better!

1. Can this question be incorporated into existing OKR? If yes, +3
2. Ease of ability to answer question (+0 = 8+ hours; +1 = 4-8 hours; +2 = 2-3 hours; +3 = 1 hour or less)
3. Priority (High = +3, Medium = +2, Low = +1)
4. Is an c-suite member asking for this? If yes, +2

If an ad-hoc request scores north of 7 points, we will re-consider prioritizing it above existing OKR work.
