*For an overview of Gainsight, and information about how to login, please refer to the [Gainsight Overview Page](/handbook/sales/gainsight/).*

### Gainsight in Salesforce

There are a few different ways to access Gainsight. The first is to access Gainsight through Okta. The second and third options require you to login to SalesForce. Once logged into Salesforce, navigate to the Account or Opportunity page, and scroll down to the Gainsight widget.  The Customer 360 page will be the default view and is customized to show high-level account data and navigational tabs specific to Account Planning. The other option, is to select the + sign on the blue navigation bar in Salesforce, and choose Gainsight NXT from the dropdown menu. Many reps prefer this view since you can see more of the entire account plan in a single pane. 

### Creating an Account Plan

1. From the Gainsight widget, use the top navigation bar to select the **Success Plan tab**.
1. In the right corner select **New Success Plan**.
1. Name your success plan indicating Land or Expand and year(s).
1. The **Type** will be Account Planning.
1. Add a due date. The account renewal date is a good place to start, although this will evolve as the plan evolves.
1. Add a template to the Account Plan by using the ellipsis menu located in the gray bar on the right side of the page. The [Land Plan](/handbook/sales/account-planning/#land-account-plans) and [Expand Plan](/handbook/sales/account-planning/#expand-account-plans) templates will provide a guided action items and next steps.
1. To learn about other plan types (Opportunity Plan, Command Plan, Success Plan), review [this page](/handbook/sales/account-planning/#what-is-the-difference-between-an-account-plan-and-a-success-plan).
   

### Locating an Existing Account Plan

1. From the Gainsight widget, use the top navigation bar to select the **Success Plan tab**.
1. In the gray bar towards the top of the widget, use the **More Plans arrow** to view the existing plans.

### Account Plan Info

1. The default view of an Account Plan will be the Plan Info section.
1. Plan Info is comprised of the Customer Profile, Execution Plan and Go-To-Market Plan. 
1. Add or edit content to the Plan Info by using the pencil icon located to the right of each text box.

### Relationship and Influence Mapping

1. From the Gainsight widget, use the top navigaion bar to select the **Contacts tab**.
1. Use the drag and drop function to add contacts to the map or use the Add Person button located to the right of the widget. 
1. Add further detail (Influence, GitLab Role, Manager) to the contact card by double clicking in the card or using the ellipsis menu.
1. Check out [this article](https://support.gainsight.com/Gainsight_NXT/07360/People_Maps/Build_People_Maps#Business_Use_Cases) from Gainsight on building maps as well as [this enablement](/handbook/sales/account-planning/#relationship-and-influence-mapping) page.

### Whitespace Mapping

This activity is best done as a team, Solutions Architects and Customer Success Managers can help ensure this section reflects the team's understanding of the opportunities within the account. 
1. In Gainsight, there are two different sections for whitespace mapping. Whitespace (Use Case) and Whitespace (Use Case Visual).
      - **Whitespace (Use Case):** This is where you will enter the data. It will flow back into Salesforce but cannot be edited in Salesforce at this time. 
      - **Whitespace (Use Case Visual):** After data has been entered, use this tab to see a visual representation of the data.  There are multiple views from which to choose. 
1. Reference this [Whitespace Mapping page](/handbook/sales/account-planning/#white-space-mapping) for further detail on the methodology.

For each use case, seek to understand if the customer is using a competing technology aligned to each of the use cases (there is a picklist in Gainsight), if there is an appetite for replacement (green indicates there is an appetite for change), and when that contract ends.
