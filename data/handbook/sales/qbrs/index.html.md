## Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Overview
QBRs are held during the **first two weeks of every quarter.** The sessions span between 5-7 business days. The goal of these sessions is to:
1. Review team performance and lessons learned from the past quarter
1. Review customer wins, use cases and insights to repeat "what good looks like" 
1. Review current quarter forecast and plans to meet and exceed sales goals in the coming quarter (and beyond)
1. Prepare CRO and GitLab E-Group for GitLab's quarterly earnings report
1. Identify and prioritize specific requests that will help Sales be successful

QBRs are categorized into two types: 
1. Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) - These sessions are held at the team- / IC-level and are organized by managers. 
1. Field Manager QBRs - These sessions include Field Managers and above and are organized by the QBR planning team. Most of the page below covers the process for Field Manager QBRs. 

### QBR Schedules
Field Manager QBRs are held in the following months and *typically* are a mix of in-person and virtual formats. This is subject to change based on any outside conditions that make it unsafe for the team to travel (i.e. COVID-19) and [GitLab's travel policy](/handbook/travel/#travel-guidance-covid-19). 

1. Feb: In-Person (FY24 TBD)
1. May: Virtual
1. Aug: Virtual
1. Nov: In-Person

Field Manager QBRs are typically organized by region and are held starting at the ASM/manager level and roll up by leadership tier from there. ASMs/managers are responsible for gathering the necessary insights and asks from their teams in self-organized, team-level QBRs. See [QBR Best Practices](/handbook/sales/qbrs/#qbr-best-practices) section for more information. Schedule overlap is avoided to the best of the planning team's ability, but note that some overlap, especially cross-segment, is typically unavoidable.

### Field Manager QBR Participation - In-Person
Participation in in-person Field Manager QBRs differs from virtual settings in order to maintain efficient budget and travel schedules. Only managers+ will be permitted to attend Field QBRs in-person – this includes attendees both in the Field organization and in supporting organizations:

1. CRO LT 
1. Regional Sales Leaders (ASM) / Managers+ of Customer Success or Channel & Alliances
1. Inside Sales Leaders
1. Regional SA & CSM Managers 
1. Channels & Alliances Leaders 
1. Professional Services Leaders 
1. Global and/or Regional Field Operations Leaders 
1. Sales Dev Leader or Regional SDR Managers 
1. Field Marketing & Demand Gen Leaders 
1. People Team 
1. Product Marketing Leaders
1. Product Delegate 

Any attendees that fall outside of the roles listed above will need to go through an approval process in order to attend in-person Field Manager QBRs. More details on the approval process coming soon.

Example: While each region has a dedicated Field Marketer who may regularly attend virtual Field Manager QBRs, only the Director of Field Marketing (or a designated delegate) will be permitted to attend in-person QBRs for budgetary considerations. 

Wherever possible, the QBR planning team will incorporate the ability for team members to participate in in-person QBRs virtually so that team members who 1) are not comfortable traveling or 2) are not permitted to attend in-person can still participate in and contribute to Field Manager QBRs. 

## QBR Best Practices

### Best Practices for Managers/ASMs/RDs/AVPs
1. Managers/ASMs are responsible for gathering insights and input from their teams to inform their Field Manager QBR presentations. These sessions should be self-organized by the managers. It is recommended that managers look at these QBR sessions as "family discussions" and keep them simple and informal to encourage team openness and knowledge-sharing. 
1. Depending on the Field Manager QBR, RDs, AVPs or VPs are considered the "hosts" of their QBR sessions. As the hosts, these leaders serve as the DRI for the attendance and schedule of their sessions. Therefore, please ensure you are being thoughtful when providing the QBR planning team with your attendee list and schedule for your session.
1. Field Manager QBRs should be an inclusive environment – QBR hosts should encourage participation from other members of their extended teams as well as delegates from other areas of the business.
   1. Invite your Channel Manager, SDR Manager, Field Marketing delegate, and/or CSM Manager to provide a brief (5 minute) update during each QBR.
   1. NOTE: ENT ASMs will co-present with SA managers. 
1. Any changes to the Field Manager QBR schedules should be made no later than two weeks before the scheduled start of *virtual* QBRs and 2 months before the scheduled start of *in-person* QBRs to avoid calendar disruptions for participants.
1. All managers/ASMs should complete their Field Manager QBR decks no later than 2 business days prior to their Field Manager QBR session. (Note: For QBRs that occur on the first business day of the new quarter, the standard is one business day.)
1. All AVPs/RDs/ASMs should pre-read other QBR decks for their session. Questions should be left ahead of time in the coordinating notes document.
   1. RDs/AVPs should review their team's QBR asks and pre-prepare a list of prioritized asks to review in their Field Manager QBR session. (See the [Field Operations QBR Request Intake Process](/handbook/sales/qbrs/#intake) below for more information.)

### Best Practices for Attendees
1. Please join on time and ensure your microphone is muted to avoid disruptions.
1. Please be an active participant in the QBR session – join on video (if possible), answer questions related to your area of expertise/team, and participate in discussions.
1. Please contribute by taking notes during the QBRs. Everyone can (and should!) contribute, but delegates from these teams are expected to pitch in on note taking:
   1. Sales Operations
   1. Field Enablement
   1. Product Marketing
   1. Field Marketing
   1. Sales Dev
   1. Channel
   1. Alliances
1. Notes taken during QBRs should provide a detailed summary of the QBR and focus on key takeaways, value-add commentary and conversation. Since QBRs are not recorded, notes are the record of the QBR. See [Note Taking](/handbook/sales/qbrs/#qbr-note-taking) section below for full note taking guidance.

## QBR Communication
1. QBR-related Slack channels will be created no later than five weeks before the start of Field Manager QBRs.
   1. The naming will follow this format:
      1. #qbr-comm-qxfyxx
      1. #qbr-ent-qxfyxx
      1. #qbr-channel-alliances-qxfyxx
      1. #qbr-cs-qxfyxx
   1. These channels will be used to:
      1. Coordinate asks/reminders for RD/ASM planning action items.
      1. Send reminders about QBR schedules and timing.
      1. Field questions about attendance.
      1. Field logistical questions (i.e. "what's the Zoom link?") that arise as QBRs are in process.
      1. Conduct follow-ups to QBR asks. (i.e. share how/where we have tracked QBR asks and inform the field of the process that will happen next to address them and where to look for updates)
   1. Uses do *not* include:
      1. Facilitate manager approval or feedback for QBR decks. This is meant to be handled by managers with their leaders via their own preferred channels.
      1. Make any QBR asks that should be included in QBR decks.
   1. These channels will be archived within 60 days of QBRs being completed.

### QBR Note Taking
The purpose of notes is to summarize and capture meaningful insights that come out of the *conversation* during a QBR - questions and answers, feedback, asks, etc. 

**Q: Who should take notes?**

A: If you are attending as a delegate, please note that it is part of your responsibility to contribute to note-taking in the QBR.

**Q: What specific information should the delegate capture?**

A: In order to serve as an active participant in QBRs, there is no need to take verbatim notes during the sessions. Providing a detailed summary of information that is shared is adequate. 
1. Make as detailed notes as possible *pertaining to key insights, decisions, asks, action items, or specific improvement requests*. Please include reference to the specific slide in the QBR presentation that pertains to the ask when possible. While the slides will not be shared with the broader team, this information will help key stakeholders easily find the referenced information.
1. Capture meaningful insights, points or key decisions that come from conversations during the QBR, not information already written in a slide.

### Where to Find Past Field Manager QBRs
1. In accordance with our [SAFE framework](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/), Field Manager QBR sessions are not recorded. Please refer to session notes instead. If you do not have access to the session notes, please request this directly from the QBR host. 

## Field Operations QBR Ask/Request Process

### Field Manager QBR Asks - Best Practices
1. Be very specific in your ask; general asks are not actionable. Asks should be geared towards helping customers & prospects; improving internal processes & productivity. 
   1. General topics of asks are: Product enhancement, Process, Pricing, Tooling, Etc. 
1. Business Impact: Explain how the “Ask” will impact the business. Will improve the customer engagement? Will it make the sales team more productive? Will it foster better collaboration amongst internal teams?
1. Owner (DRI): Assign the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for this ask. The DRI cannot be a Sales Mgr/Leader or Rep. 
1. Requested Due Date: Provide a due date for the request. This will assist with prioritization for the DRIs and internal teams working on the ask.
   1. Bonus: If there is an issue that has been created for your ask, link it in your deck!
1. The Ask should focus on cross-functional teams. Try to avoid “intra-sales” asks that can be addressed during the quarter as a standard course of business. 

### Intake

1. ASMs are encouraged to share their top asks for leadership and supporting teams as a part of their QBRs. The asks will be prioritized by segment  leadership before being passed off to Sales Ops.
   1. Enterprise Ask Prioritization Process
      1. ASM collects asks from teams, prioritizes and includes a slide of the top 3 asks in their QBR presentation
      1. RDs/AVPs will review and prioritize their region's top asks and present them in the ENT Leadership QBR.
      1. RDs and ENT Sales VP will review full list of ENT asks in subsequent RD meeting and will deliver a final list of prioritized ENT asks (no more than 5 asks per functional group) no later than the Monday following the ENT Leadership QBR.
   1. Commercial Ask Prioritization Process
      1. ASM collects asks from teams, prioritizes and includes a slide of the top 3 asks in their QBR presentation
      1. RDs will present their region's top asks in the COMM Leadership QBR.
      1. ASMs, RDs and COMM Sales VP will review full list of COMM asks and will deliver a final list of prioritized COMM asks no later than the Monday following the COMM Leadership QBR.


1. Field Operations will share a list of consolidated QBR asks and next steps for each no later than three weeks following the last QBR. 
1. The DRI for each ask is responsible for creating a new issue related to the QBRR ask OR identifying and updating an existing issue.  
   1. Leaders/Managers  are encouraged to discuss any asks that were not included in the final list with the requestor in their 1:1 to determine how/if any action should be taken.
   1. NOTE: Reps can/should make asks of Field Ops at any time outside of QBRs using [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/sales-operations/-/issues/new?issuable_template=FieldOpsQBR).

### Execution and Tracking

All new QBR asks are tracked and managed as issues within the DRI's team Project and will include a global `QBR` label and year/quarter specific `FYxx-Qx QBR` label to ensure the asks are categorized appropriately for review.
