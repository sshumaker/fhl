## Overview
_[The original and internal-to-GitLab proof points Google Doc is online, here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tuhg6LO0e6R-KP7Vfwb8cggHDiBzkC26pBl0lyLS7UY/edit) while some parts of this handbook page are being approved for publication._

Proof points with third-party validation are a key resource, whether from [customers](#customer-references-and-case-studies), [analysts](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/proof-points/#analyst-reports-and-studies), [industry awards](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/proof-points/#industry-awards), or [peer reviews](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/proof-points/#peer-reviews), and they are augmented here with [Gitlab's own industry research](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/proof-points/#gitlab-reports-and-studies).

Articulating value is a critical sales skill in achieving [Command of the Message](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/).

### GitLab Reports and Studies

<big>[2020 Global Developer Report: DevSecOps](/developer-survey/)</big><br>
**Findings Included:** A majority of developer respondents, 66%, said their organization does make it possible for them to avoid hacks.
DevSecOps = changing roles: Security can be found on cross-functional teams and working closely in collaboration with developers, both of which represent significant change from the past.
<br>
**Customer Value:** Building security into the DevOps pipeline improves overall security.<br>
**Value Drivers:** Risk<br>
**Usecase** DevSecOps

----

<big>[2020 Global Developer Report: DevSecOps](/developer-survey/)</big><br>
**Findings Included:** DevOps = faster releases: If you’re a developer, DevOps just works. Nearly 83% of them report they’re releasing code more quickly.
About 35% report code is released twice as rapidly, while nearly 25% said it’s now being released 10 times faster.
<br>
**Customer Value:** Automated testing in the CI pipeline accelerates delivery, finding defects earlier.<br>
**Value Drivers:** Speed<br>
**Usecase** DevSecOps

----

<big>[2020 Global Developer Report: DevSecOps](/developer-survey/)</big><br>
**Findings Included:** CD is real: Nearly 60% deploy multiple times a day, once a day, or once every few days. That’s up from 45% last year.  And 74% of organizations report they have shifted testing left, meaning they’ve moved it earlier into the development process.<br>
**Customer Value:** Visibility and transparency into future work leads to more efficient planning and execution.<br>
