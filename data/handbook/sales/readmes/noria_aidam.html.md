<!-- This template will help you build out your very own GitLab README, a great tool for transparently letting others know what it's like to work with you, and how you prefer to be communicated with. Each section is optional. You can remove those you aren't comfortable filling out, and add sections that are germane to you. -->

## About me

[**Consider embedding a video of you working or being interviewed, along with 5-10 bullet points outlining interesting tidbits about you and your interests. Focus these on non-work attributes. Also, add detail on what GitLab values and sub-values resonate most with you. This enables ice-breakers to occur ahead of meetings.**]
-->

## My working style

<!-- Add 5-10 bullets on how you prefer to work, interact with others, and learn. You may optionally include intel from Strength Deployment Inventory, Myers—Briggs, etc. This is most effective when you are precise and specific about your norms, assumptions, and expectations. If you are unsure what would be helpful here, ask your colleagues for their input. You may learn something from listening to outside perspective! -->

**Response time for emails and meeting follow-ups**: I will always do my best to provide same-day responses to customer inquiries and follow-ups unless otherwise noted.  

**Calendar**: Schedule things as necessary right on my calendar during working hours — I'll do my best to keep my calendar up to date. However, if you see only one empty slot for a day or if it looks like the meeting would be back to back with something else, please check with me before confirming dates and times.

**Continuous Learning**: Things at GitLab move really fast, and I need time to keep up. I like to be in touch with the people I am working with, even if it's every 2 or 3 days, just so I m sure I am going to the right direction. 
Having clear instructions and being direct

## What I assume about others

<!-- Add 5-10 bullets on the assumptions you typically hold when working with others. Strive to be as open with these as possible, so others understand your perspective when engaging with you on projects. Remember, the honesty put forth in these answers enables others to be more understanding and empathetic. -->

I assume that if there is anything you are expecting from me to do, it is clearly stated and written down somewhere that we both can access. Unless it is at the genesis of a particular ask, it is best to ensure that you and I agree that this is my task before others are engaged in our conversation.

## What I want to earn

<!--Consider 3-5 bullets on your goals for earning things like trust and respect, or a broader understanding of new topics. This enables others to understand what motivates you. -->

Trust, Confidence in my knowledge of the product, in the team and the organisation

## Communicating with me

<!-- Consider 5-10 bullets on your communication preferences. This includes traditional styles such as verbal, textual, and visual, but you are encouraged to be precise. You can mention things like routine, availability, your travel habits, etc. This helps others understand why you communicate in the manner than you do, and it enables them to tailor their communication in a way that resonates most with you.
-->

I will always try to be available for any queries or question and I'll do my best to always provide a same day answer. I am most responsive on:

1. Slack (For me it is always preferable to call as it helps me get the message across quickly ,so do not hesitate to call me on slack unless there is no need and just a message is enough)
1. Email


Don't hesitate to try a different medium if my response time is poor.

## Strengths/Weaknesses
