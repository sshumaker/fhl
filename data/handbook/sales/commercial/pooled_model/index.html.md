## Pooled Model

All members of the Sales, Support, Billing and Deal Desk teams should familiarize themselves with the Low Touch Sales Motion/ Pooled Model in AMER.  This sales motion leverages team-level account alignment so Pooled SMB customers have a team of AE’s to assist them.  Every AE on the Pooled Account Team is equipped to work with a Pooled customer as the sales point of contact.

Pooled SMB customers are all SMB customers with a CARR of <$1k, and in some cases SMB customers with a CARR of <$3k.

Pooled Accounts are owned by Poooled AE's (Tier 1/1.5 accounts), and by [Pooled Sales User](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0058X00000F1YFq?noredirect=1&isUserEntityOverride=1) (Tier 2/3 accounts). Note that accounts owned by the Pooled Sales User closely monitored and should not be considered ownerless.

## Pooled Customer Account Ranking

All Pooled SMB customers are now auto ranked/ tiered based on a criteria devised by the Self Service team.  These auto ranks are based on a combination of factors and thresholds (see table below).

| Tier ↓/SFDC Field → | CARR $ | Total Funding $ | Industry                                          | LAM (LAM dev count) | Combination                   |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Tier 1               | 2,964  | 134,985,000     | N/A                                               | 103                     | Any 1                         |
|                      | 2,400  | 44,909,650      | SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare | 44                      | Any 2                         |
|                      | 1,916  | 20,624,700      | SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare | 29                      | Any 3                         |
| Tier 3               | <1500  | N/A             | N/A                                               | <25                     | Both                          |
| Tier 2               | N/A    | N/A             | N/A                                               | N/A                     | Not equal to Tier 1 or Tier 2 |


Rank 2 & 3 accounts are re-ranked on a monthly basis, and should any meet the criteria to be a Rank 1 account, their rank will be updated and the account auto assinged to a Pooled AE. 

If they are re-ranked from Rank 2/3 to Rank 1, it will be due of 1 of 3 scenarios;

1. Renewal Uptier = An increase in CARR moved them to Rank 1
2. Non renewal Uptier = A recent change in funding or LAM Dev count moved them to Rank 1.
3. New Account moving from FO to Pool = A new account enters the Pool that hits the criteria to be a Rank 1.

Rank 1 accounts will not be re-ranked on a monthly basis.  They will only be re-ranked at time of renewal. This means that the Pooled AE owning this account will own them throughout their subscription term.  

If an account churns, it is possible that the account will be downtiered, and moved to the Pooled Sales User. 

If an AE engages with a Rank 2/3 account via a case (Rank 2/3 account case creation is detailed below), they can nomiate the account to be uptiered to a Rank 1.

They can only do this if strict criteria is met;

1. The account was enriched incorrectly, i.e the website does not match the company name.  This would mean that industry, funding, LAM dev count are void and the autmated rank cnnot be relied upon, AND
2. The renewal date is not in the next 30 days, AND
3. The AE has engaged, and logged an activity on the contact/ acount/ case/ opp within the last 7 days, AND
4. Add on/ License increase quote with nARR >$0 has been created.

An AE cannot manually uptier or downtier an account. 

**A Pooled AE can is however free to prioritize the accounts they own, by shifiting them from to a Rank 1, to 1.5.  This will not change account ownership.**


## Account Ownership

Pooled AEs own all Pooled accounts where the Rank = 1/ 1.5.
As detailed above, accounts are auto ranked by Self Service Ops.
At the start of FY24, all Pooled AEs will own approx 50 accounts. Based on our analysis, this will increase to 80 as new accounts enter the Pool throughout the year.
This represents approx 15% of the total Pooled Account base.
These customers have high growth potential, and require dedicated AE coverage

The Pooled Sales User will own all accounts where the Rank = 2/ 3.
This represents 85% of the total Pooled Account base.
These customers are mainly self serve and do not warrant dedicated AE focus. They will only be engaged with on a transactional basis, when sales assistance is absolutely nessecery.

## Opportunity Ownership

Each Pooled AE will own all opportunities under the accounts they own (Pooled Accounts where the Rank = 1/1.5)
This includes QSR and Web Direct opp that are auto created & auto closed won under these accounts.

The Pooled Sales User will own all opportunities under Pooled accounts (Pooled Accounts where the Rank = 2/3), including scenarios where an AE was required to engage to transact the renewal opportunity. 
This includes QSR and Web Direct opportunities that are auto created & auto closed won under these accounts.


## Engaging with Tier 1 Accounts

Pooled AEs own Rank 1/1.5 Accounts and Opportunities, and they should focus on growing these accounts.  These accounts/ opps can be viewed and worked through any report/ list view set to 'My Accounts', or 'My Opportunities'

## Engaging with Tier 2/3 Accounts

Since Rank 2/3 accounts are owned by the Pooled Sales User, Pooled AEs will only engage with these customers when any of the below scenarios are triggered, and will engage through the subsequent case that is created.

Triggers are split into 3 categories based on the scenario type.  The category a trigger falls into it is annotated in the subsequent case subject line;

- RT: Reactive Trigger. Due to a GitLab internal challege, the customer will need sales assistance in order to transact.
- PRO: Proactive Trigger.  Due to customer behavior, they would welcome a conversation with sales due to increase usage/ growth. 
- HR: Hand Raise. The customer has notified us that they require sales assistance. 

### Failed Auto Renewals - Reactive Trigger

These customers think they are going to auto renew, but they will not. They need a Pooled AE to help them transact the renewal. 

#### Process

Every month, the Product team identifies all Auto Renewal Opps that are destined to fail.
Once identified, this list of renewal opportunities, that now require Sales Assistance, is published via Highspot, and on a SFDC dashbaord. 
Once the list is published, Self Service Ops will create cases for each opp due to fail.  

The cases are expected to enter the [Pooled Sales Team Case Queue at least 30 days before the opp close date. 
Once these cases enter the queue, they should be picked up on a first in first out basis.  
Should the AE need to adjust the close date, add notes, create a new quote on the opp in question (which will be listed in the case), they are free to do so.  
Once resolved, the case and the opp should be closed by the AE.

#### Policy

Once cases are created based on auto renewal opps that are due to fail, an AE should pick up the case on a first in first out basis.  The oldest open case in the queue should always be picked up first, regardless of the case subject. 
When they work the case, and set to the opp to close won, credit will fall under the Pooled Sales User

### How Pooled AEs work Cases

- If a Pooled AE has capacity, they will click on an open case in the [Pooled Sales Team Queue](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/500?fcf=00B8X000009wTi0) and assign it to themselves, by changing the **Case Owner**.
- Based on the email address entered during case creation, the Contact and Account will be automatically populated on the case. If there is no match, the Pooled AE should manually add in the customer Contact. This will then auto populate the Account field.
- Information pertaining to the case will be displated in the **Web Form Details Section**, and/ or the **Description** box, based on the trigger that created the case.
- Once assigned to a Pooled AE, the **Status** should be set to **In Progress**. This will also update the **Date/ Time First Responded** and **Time to First Response** fields.
- The **Case Reason** should be updated based on the nature of the customer's request. If the case owner is unsure of what **Case Reason** to select, they can refer to this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1cWuGo4XCAQmzMBcfUjF7Emr2undkz1ufcUFt4HKmIns/edit).
- To work the case, the Pooled AE should contact the customer, adding relevant activities to the case, and/ or the related opportunity. They are also able to update the **Notes** field on the case,
- Once a Case is considered resolved, the **Status** should be set to one of the four Closed options, and the **Resolution Action** updated. This will automatically update the **Date/ Time Closed** field.
- If applicable, the related opportunity should also be closed. 
- At any time, a Pooled AE can view their cases by navigating to the **My Cases** list view in Salesforce.
