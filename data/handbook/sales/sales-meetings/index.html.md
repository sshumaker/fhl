### General Guidelines for Presenters
1. Provide your final agenda times by end of day on the business day before the meeting. Your agenda updates should link to relevant references (Handbook pages, issues, MRs, etc.) that provide more context, and you should include where the field can go with more questions and/or feedback that isn't discussed on the call.
1. Please be respectful of time and keep your updates to 1-2 minutes max – focusing on the most impactful learning or takeaway. We want to leave ample time for questions.
   1. If you feel your update requires more context, consider recording a quick video with more background that the field can watch asynchronously.
1. Slides are not necessary, but if you would like to present slides, ensure that you also include a link to the presentation in the agenda.
1. Once you are done presenting, please handoff to the next presenter on the agenda.

## Focus Fridays
The Field team practices Focus Fridays. The goal is to encourage all field team members to clear out their calendars on Fridays as much as possible in hopes that this will help all of us be more efficient, allow space within our weeks for focused work, and reduce potential burnout. Guidance for Focus Fridays includes:  
- Cancel or move any standing meetings occurring on Fridays
- Customer/prospect/partner/external meetings are exceptions
- Some one-off internal meetings might not be avoidable, but aim to minimize them as much as possible
- Consider blocking off your calendar as "busy" on Fridays to block your work time
- Consider looking into apps like [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/) that can provide recommendations on how to refactor your calendar for focused work 

You are encouraged to talk to your manager for guidance on how best to embrace Focus Fridays on your team and with your individual schedule.
