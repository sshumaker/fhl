1. Made significant improvements to Quote Templates, which are [summarized in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/deal-desk/-/issues/9)

### What's New in GitLab üöÄ
The GitLab [13.3 release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/) is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:
- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams can now discover real-world software vulnerabilities faster and more efficiently with coverage-guided fuzz testing that surfaces and solves vulnerabilities in C, C++, and Go and with on-demand DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) that can now be run from the GUI and includes new vulnerability evidence for security staff.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** 13.3 makes it easier to release code more frequently with a new build matrix for CI/CD that allows customers to build powerful workflows, as well as with enhanced tracking and analytics for Merge Requests including throughput in the MR Analytics Dashboard and traceability of fulfilled duties by different roles in the Compliance Dashboard.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** Customers can increase the productivity and efficiency of delivery teams by leveraging new features that improve the ease and usability of building and distributing packages. These include an overhaul of the entire Package registry GUI (plus availability for everyone in Free) and enhancements that make it easier to publish NuGet packages in an automated way.
