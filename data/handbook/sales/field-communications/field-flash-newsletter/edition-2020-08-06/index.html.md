### What's New in GitLab üöÄ
The GitLab [13.2 release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/) is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:
- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** The first release of Container Host Security gives security administrators confidence and peace of mind by allowing them to secure their running containers at the host level through monitoring and optionally blocking unexpected activity.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** 13.2 delivers new updates to improve teams‚Äô efficiency and performance. This includes advanced global search on GitLab.com, which improves search relevancy, performance, and allows for group-wide searches across all projects directly in the UI. It also includes load performance testing directly in GitLab, allowing customers to better understand how their application performs under stress by easily running custom load tests as part of their CI/CD pipelines.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** Managing workflows and planning tasks for different teams can cause a significant amount of development disruption. Organizations can now lessen this disruption and streamline agile project planning/management with our MVC release of Iterations, which allows teams to break down work into smaller, more manageable chunks. Customers can also leverage enhancements to our Jira integration and epics (confidential epics and bulk edits) to make project management easier in GitLab.

[Visit the 13.2 Release Post for more details](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/07/22/gitlab-13-2-released/)
