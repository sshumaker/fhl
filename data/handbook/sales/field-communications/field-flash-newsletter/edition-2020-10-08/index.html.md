### What's New in GitLab üöÄ
The GitLab 13.4 release is live! Here are the takeaways for customers and prospects:
- **Reduce Security and Compliance Risk:** Teams can expand their DevSecOps with enhanced security capabilities including the ability to use HashiCorp Vault secrets in CI jobs, grant users deployment permissions without code access, and deploy to Kubernetes clusters from GitLab without the need to open a cluster to the entire Internet. In addition, the Instance Security Dashboard has evolved into the GitLab Security Center featuring Vulnerability Reporting and Settings.
- **Increase Operational Efficiencies:** 13.4 brings with it a more efficient UX experience with improved global search capabilities that includes quick navigation from the search bar, GitLab Pages Redirects for redirecting individual pages and directories within a site, and the ability to manage hundreds of supported project deployments from the Environments dashboard.
- **Deliver Better Products Faster:** GitLab is introducing inline code coverage remarks inside MR diffs which provide developers a visual representation of code coverage in the Merge Request diff when reviewing. Knowing whether modified code is covered by a unit test helps speed up code reviews and time to merge and deploy a feature. GitLab also moved feature flags to Starter and plan to move feature flags to Free in 13.5.

[Visit the 13.4 Release Post for more details](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/)
