## Overview
Following each GitLab release [on the 22nd of each month](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/), Field Communications creates a pitch template in Highspot that members of the Field organization can repurpose to send to their customers and prospects. The purpose of this pitch template is to make it easy for team members to quickly share the technical details of the latest release and create a meaningful touch-point with their customer or prospect. 

### Format 
The quick format includes: 
1. An overview of [GitLab's value drivers](/handbook/sales/command-of-the-message/)
1. 3-4 main/noteworthy features of the release
1. 3-4 updates from GitLab, usually helpful content or big announcements 
1. All release details from the [GitLab Releases page.](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/)

### Process
1. Pitch template is generated by 11 am CT on the 22nd (or first business day) of each month
   1. Reminder in #sales-all Slack channel, cross-post to #sdr_global
