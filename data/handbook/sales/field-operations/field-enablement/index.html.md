## Overview

### Field Enablement Vision
Motivate and inspire the field organization and partners to achieve high levels of success through the acquisition and application of knowledge, skills and behaviors that improve productivity and accelerate growth

### Field Enablement Mission
Design and deliver effective enablement solutions that grow field team members' and partners' expertise and confidence to drive efficient, predictable, and scalable growth for GitLab

### Objectives
1. Improve field efficiency (direct and indirect routes to market) with effective training solutions to address prioritized knowledge and skill gaps and build a culture of learning
1. Orchestrate people, process, information, and technology to evolve sales conversations and simplify the ecosystem within which field team members operate
1. Ensure that the GitLab field organization is regularly informed about relevant business and organizational updates

### How We Do This
- Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders (*including but not limited to Sales, Customer Success, Marketing, Sales/CS/Channel Ops, Product/Engineering, Sales Strategy & Analytics, and the People team*) to address prioritized knowledge, behavior, and skill gaps in the GitLab field organization to achieve desired business outcomes
- Define, coordinate, and/or lead the development and delivery of effective enablement solutions (*training, technology, knowledge, content, process, and tools*) for GitLab Sales, Customer Success, and Partners throughout all phases of the customer journey as well as different stages of each team member's tenure and/or experience at or with GitLab
- Ensure field team members are regularly informed about relevant business and organizational updates and have access to enablement materials necessary for their day-to-day work to meet and exceed business objectives
- Cultivate a culture of curiosity, iteration, and continuous learning & development across the GitLab field organization

## Handbook-First Approach to GitLab Learning and Development Materials

- Our [Mission](/company/mission/#mission) is that Everyone Can Contribute, and our most important value is [Results](/handbook/values/#results). Like we've extended that to the Handbook, we want to extend it to our learning materials.
- We want to leverage the best of an e-learning platform, with the benefits of reminders, interactivity, and more but make sure the materials we produce are also available to those who aren't using an e-learning platform, while fulfilling [our mission](/company/mission/#mission).
- There are benefits to keeping our e-learning material [handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first):
    - Folks who have already completed a formal training through an e-learning platform may want to return to the materials
    - Those who never go through the formal platform may also benefit from the materials
    - The handbook continues to be the SSOT, with the e-learning platform leveraging handbook materials through screenshots, embeds, and more

Learn how the GitLab Corporate Learning & Development team takes a [Handbook-first approach to interactive learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/).

## Six Critical Questions

Inspired by _The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business_ by Patrick Lencioni

<details>
<summary markdown="span">1. Why does the GitLab Field Enablement team exist?</summary>
See our team mission in the [Overview](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/#overview) section.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">2. How do we behave?</summary>

On our best day, we show up with a positive attitude while demonstrating [GitLab’s values](/handbook/values/) along with the following behaviors to overcome the [Five Dysfunctions](/handbook/values/#five-dysfunctions):

- **Trust**: Extend trust, actively listen, and assume noble intent; give and receive feedback with respect and solicit feedback often
- **Embrace Healthy Conflict**: Engage in constructive conflict for the purpose of achieving shared goals & objectives; resolve personal issues, quickly and directly
- **Commitment**: Support decisions once decisions are made with a GitLab team-first approach
- **Accountability**: Hold ourselves and each other accountable while encouraging each other & celebrating successes
- **Results**: Strong drive for results and a focus on the customer; demonstrate passion for continuous learning & improvement

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">3. What does the Field Enablement team do?</summary>
See "How we do this" in the [Overview](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/#overview) section.
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">4. What does success look like?</summary>

The below is a work in progress as we define success measures across each stage of the customer journey:

- **Engage & Educate the Customer**
    - Increase # of rep-sourced opps
    - Accelerate sales cycle time and improve conversion of MQLs to SAOs
    - Accelerate and improve predictability of new rep ramp time
- **Progress the Opportunity & Close the Deal**
    - Increase # of closed deals per rep
    - Accelerate sales cycle time and improve conversion of SAOs to Closed/Won deals
    - Increase average sale price (inclusive of improved product mix to sell more Premium and Ultimate)
    - Accelerate and improve predictability of new rep ramp time
    - Improve forecasting accuracy
    - Improve win rates
- **Retain & Expand**
    - Improve renewal rates (inclusive of up-sell and cross-sell)
    - Accelerate customer time to value
    - Increase breadth of stage adoption

Activity does not equal Performance 
Knowledge does not equal Capability 

Activity x Capability = Performance 
Knowledge x Practice = Capability

## Making a Field Enablement Request

If you have a great training idea and/or enablement request, we'd love to hear it! Please make an enablement request by following this quick process:

- Submit an issue using [this issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/enablement/-/issues/new?issuable_template=field-enablement-request)
    - Please be descriptive in the issue in order to give our team the necessary context to review and prioritize your request. Note that ALL questions must be answered prior to Field Enablement triaging your request.
- Upon submitting your request, the issue will be tagged as `FE priority::new request` and `FE status::triage`
- Field Enablement will triage the request as quickly as possible. Upon examining the request, the team will assess the priority and status by labeling it with one of the following labels (please see label definitions in section below):
    - Priority:
        - `FE priority::1`
        - `FE priority::2`
        - `FE priority::3`
    - Status:
        - `FE status::wip`
        - `FE status::backlog`
- Field Enablement will collaborate with the requester on the request details directly in the issue to clarify any missing information, set up a discovery call, and/or update on next steps.
- [Click here](/handbook/sales/field-operations/field-enablement/prioritization-framework) for a deeper look into the Field Enablement team's prioritization framework

If you have a Field Communications request (process change, announcement, etc.), please see the request process outlined [here](/handbook/sales/field-communications/#requesting-field-announcements).
