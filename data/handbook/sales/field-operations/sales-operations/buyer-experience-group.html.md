### Buyer Experience Group (BEG)

The GitLab Buyer Experience Group (BEG) is comprised of leadership from Sales, Revenue Operations, Billing, Product and Pricing. This unified team evaluates new strategic initiatives, develops necessary processes and ultimately operationalizes changes to the Buyer Experience.

This team evaluates all initiatives and makes prioritization decisions based on the impact to the Buyer of the GitLab product. This Buyer interacts with unique areas of the product (webstore, customers portal, marketplaces, reseller portals) and a range of functions (internal sales, billing, support, resellers). To properly prioritize initiatives to improve their GitLab experience we need a group of decision makers with a broad view into these tools and our operations.
