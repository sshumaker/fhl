## Overview

The Buyer Experience encompasses all of the systems, processes and interactions that influence the experience of a person purchasing and managing a GitLab subscription. This includes customer-facing tools and services, such as the GitLab webstore and Customer Portal, as well as internal processes that impact the customer experience, such as the contracting process and billing. 

### Buyer Experience Group (BEG)

The GitLab Buyer Experience Group (BEG) is comprised of leadership from Sales, Revenue Operations, Billing, Product and Pricing. This unified team evaluates new strategic initiatives, develops necessary processes and ultimately operationalizes changes to the Buyer Experience.

This team evaluates all initiatives and makes prioritization decisions based on the impact to the Buyer of the GitLab product. This Buyer interacts with unique areas of the product (webstore, customers portal, marketplaces, reseller portals) and a range of functions (internal sales, billing, support, resellers). To properly prioritize initiatives to improve their GitLab experience we need a group of decision makers with a broad view into these tools and our operations.

### Internal Handbook

The [Buyer Experience Group Internal Handbook](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/sales/buyer-experience-group/) page captures internal-only information, including an up-to-date project tracker.
