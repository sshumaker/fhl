## CS Ops Board, Groups, Projects, and Labels

### CS Operations Board

The CS Ops team uses issues and issue boards to track our projects and tasks. If you need help with a project, please open an issue and add the ~CSOps label anywhere within the GitLab repo.

CS Operations uses a [global issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/3156857?label_name[]=CSOps) to capture and track issues in any group or sub-group in the repo.

See the [global issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations/-/boards/4341765?label_name[]=CS%20Ops%20Technical%20Writing) for CS Ops Technical Writing.

### Groups

- Use the `gitlab.com` group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Sales Team group.
- Use the GitLab Sales Team group for epics that may include issues within and outside the Field Operations group.

### Projects

Create issues in the [CS Operations project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/customer-success-operations).

### Issue Weighting

- Weight = 1: 0-1 hours of work
- Weight = 3: 1-3 hours of work
- Weight = 5: 3-5 hours of work
- Weight = 7: 5-7 hours of work

Anything that takes longer than a day of work should be captured in an epic/multiple issues

## Peer Review
The peer review process (currently for issues related to Gainsight) allows CS Ops team members to have another member of the team review their work.

The issue owner is responsible for making sure the issue is completed in timely manner, including communicating to the peer reviewer when the issue needs to be completed. The peer reviewer is responsible for completing the review in the timeframe given by the issue owner.

- Issues **MUST** be peer reviewed by the Gainsight Admin if it is a change, addition, or removal in a rule or data object (e.g. creating a new rule or connector job, removing fields from an object, combining multiple rules into one)
- For changes to reports or dashboards, strongly consider a peer review.

Feel free to ask for a peer review for other any updates if you feel it would be helpful to have a second opinion.

To start the peer review process:
1. Provide a Summary of the work you have completed in the **Resolution** section on the GitLab issue
2. Change the issue status to `CS Ops::Awaiting Feedback`
3. Tag the teammate completing the peer review and comment on the issue that it is ready for peer review
4. The issue owner will remain an assignee as they are ultimately responsible for the issue completion.
