## CustomersDot Access and Use - Sales

### What is CustomersDot

[CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com) is our Customer Portal. In addition to the user-facing aspects of it, there's an [Admin section](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin) with additional internal functionality.

### CustomersDot Use Cases

**Lookup all issued licenses for a customer/prospect**

It provides an understanding of who and how many trials they have requested, when, and for how many users. [Self-Requested Trials](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/) are not easily reported.

**Cross-reference a license with version.gitlab.com**

It's the only way to search for usage ping data if the server name is not known. For example a customer acmeinc.com uses acmeinc.ninja. There is no straightforward way to find this.

**Quickly find which email address was used to deliver a license**

It is important to know who received the license for further troubleshooting as CustomersDot is the SSOT for license information.

### Logging in

To get access, file an access request for [customers.gitlab.com/admin/](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/sign_in) ([example access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/14359)).

Once access is granted, either go to [customers.gitlab.com/admin/](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/sign_in) and click “Sign in with Okta” or go to your Okta App and look for the Customers Portal App.
