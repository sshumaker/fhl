#### Updating Expiring Certificates 
The Salesforce knowledge base has [a resource](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000329338&type=1&mode=1) that addressed what to do and how to handle Expiring certificates. Currently in Salesforce our certificate is located in two places and needs to be updated in both. In order to update please follow the below steps and update in the following locations. 
- Create a new certificate by searching for `Certificate and Key Management` in setup. From there create a self-signed certificate and ensure that the options match the certificat you are replaceing. Please note that the information in the `Certificate` field will be slightly differnt between the old an new certificate. Then update the certificate in the following locations 
   - [SAML Single Sign-On Settings](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0LE4M0000004J63)
      - To update the certificate here update the certificate in the `Request Signing Certificate` picklist. (Do not upload the Salesforce Created Certificate into the file `Identity Provider Certificate`)
   - [Identity Provider](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/setup/secur/idp/IdpPage.apexp)
      - To update the certificate here update the certificate in the `Label` picklist
