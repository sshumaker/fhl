## Standard Channel Practices
For detailed information on GitLab’s Channel Partner Program, visit the [Channel Partner Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/). Partners must be an Authorized GitLab Partner _and have completed one sales certification_ to transact any GitLab products or services. To achieve authorization, partners must have an executed agreement and meet the requirements of the GitLab Partner Program. Only GitLab partners in good standing may sell GitLab products and services unless specifically approved on a case-by-case basis by the GitLab partner program team. Partners must [sign up](https://partners.gitlab.com/) to be authorized. 
 
### Policy and Process
All [**Partner Co-Sell**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-co-sell) opportunities require an authorized GitLab Partner(s) to transact the deal. Deal Registration is not applicable for Partner Co-Sell opportunities. 
[**Partner Sourced Deal Registration**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration) opportunities also require an authorized GitLab Partner to transact, and must also be found/created and registered in the [GitLab Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) (excludes Alliances and GSIs). The applicable GitLab Channel Managers must approve the registered opportunity to qualify for partner program discounts and incentives. Partner Sourced Deal Registration opportunities are either:
1. Net-new to GitLab
2. An upsell/add-on for an existing GitLab customer
Partner Sourced Deal Registration logic needs to match `Sales Qualified Source = Channel Generated` on the opportunity.  

For more information: [Deal Registration Program Overview](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-GitLab/#deal-registration-program-overview).

### Billing Contacts in Partner Accounts
When onboarding a new partner that will be purchasing directly from GitLab, a billing account must be created. Upon being notified of a new partner, the Channel Manager should ensure there is a contact created within the account that represents the partner's account's payable contact information. Chatter '@billing-ops' on the account record, provide the accounts payable contact information, and ask for a billing account to be set up. Partner accounts that will transact via distribution do not need a billing account set up. More information on billing accounts can be found on the [Billing Operations Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/accounting/finance-ops/billing-ops/).
 
### Quoting Requirements for Channel Deals
When a deal is being transacted via the Channel, and a discount other than the defined Program discounts are being offered, a GitLab quote is ***required***. At a minimum, a [Draft Proposal](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#how-to-create-a-draft-proposal) needs to be created and provided to the Partner.
Discounted quotes not in SFDC and sent to a Partner are not permitted within any GEO or Sales Segment. This includes providing product and discounted pricing quote details in an email.  

For ease with quoting, there is a [Partner Discount Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiT_2EsnL20c4w0hyZ_CGaJQIzj8CSCsHERoR80cwws/edit?usp=sharing) for use by internal GitLab Team Members. 

Channel-specific quoting instructions can be found in the [Deal Desk Quote Configuration handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#zuora-quote-configuration-guide---standard-quotes).
 
### Opportunity Requirements to Request a Quote
Sales Reps and/or ISRs are [responsible for quoting](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#what-quotes-can-deal-desk-assist-me-with) and [PO remittance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#po-remittance) on all standard GitLab direct and reseller-direct opportunities. For quotes going through distribution, please review [Transacting Through Distribution](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#transacting-through-distribution), then Chatter @ Partner Operations on the opportunity with the following information:
- For opportunities that include a Partner Sourced Deal Registration, the registration [must be linked to the opportunity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities) before requesting a quote
- Sold-To Contact: the email address the license will be sent to at the customer account
- Invoice Owner: The distributor processing the deal. If there’s no distributor on the deal, Sales Rep and/or ISR are responsible for quoting
- Reseller name
- Special Terms or Notes (if applicable)
- License Start Date
- Product information: Premium or Ultimate, Self-Managed or SaaS, Number of seats, number of years
- Any additional sales discounts outside of standard programmatic partner discounts
- For Renewals: Admin dashboard screenshot to verify any required add-ons and/or true-ups

### Transacting Through Distribution
**For Commercial Markets:**
*   Open Partners should transact with the authorized distributor(s) in their region.
*   Select Partners may choose to transact directly with GitLab (excluding certain regions) or via the region's authorized distributor(s).
*   In EMEA: Partners transact with Amazic via gitlab@amazic.com.
*   In APAC (several countries):  Partners transact with Tech Data/TD Synnex, who can be contacted at: https://www.techdata.com/apac/en/partner-with-us/become-a-partner.html
    *   In India: Partners may also choose to transact with Redington via gitlab@redington.co.in.
    *   In Japan: Partners may also choose to transact with Networld, who can be contacted at: https://www.networld.co.jp/product/gitlab/
 
**For US PubSec:**
*   Partners transact with Carahsoft via gitlab@carahsoft.com
*   PubSec distribution is not managed by GitLab Partner Order Operations

Distributors have their own pricelist and are equipped to self-quote and order new business or other order types from it without receiving an official GitLab quote, as long as pricing is at standard programmatic discounts. So, there may be times, especially in multiple bid scenarios, where you may not be aware of the partner(s) bidding on an opportunity until we receive a PO.

#### External Distributor Quote Requests
If a reseller requests a quote from a distributor via the aliases above, any non-PubSec distributors will contact partnerorderops@gitlab.com to request an official quote. Partner Order Ops will generate and provide the quote to distribution upon request as long as the request aligns to standard programmatic discounts. To further clarify internal rules of engagement, Partner Order Ops:
*   will include the GitLab Sales rep when sending a quote to distribution for visibility and awareness, but does not have an added internal approval step when discounting is programmatic (quote is auto-approved as it's programmatic).
*   will contact the GitLab Sales rep for approval prior to the quote being finalized and sent when discounting is non-programmatic.

#### Internal Distributor Quote Requests 
If you are working with a partner and need a distributor quote sent, please either: 
*   chatter @ Partner Operations on the opportunity with the [necessary quote information](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#opportunity-requirements-to-request-a-quote).
*   email the [necessary quote information](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#opportunity-requirements-to-request-a-quote) and opportunity link to partnerorderops@gitlab.com.

#### Partner Order Operations Quote and Order Management Process
*   Partner Order Ops generates quote with [necessary quote information](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#opportunity-requirements-to-request-a-quote), ensuring:
    *   standard programmatic discounts are applied for both distributor and reseller; or,
    *   if discounts requested are non-standard, approvals are requested and received either via quote approval flow or chatter.
*   Partner Order Ops sends quote to distributor with Opportunity Owner copied.
*   Partner Order Ops receives distributor PO and confirms whether all information on PO matches GitLab quote as aligned to [opportunity booking requirements](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#opportunity-booking-requirements).
    *   If PO and quote match, Partner Order Ops attaches PO to opportunity.
    *   If PO and quote do not match, Partner Order Ops requests any necessary PO updates from distributor, or makes any internal quote adjustments as needed.
*   Partner Order Ops attaches PO to opportunity and then submits opportunity for approval. Partner Order Ops then: 
    *   monitors opportunity to ensure it is updated to Closed-Won.
    *   notifies Distributor when order has been fully processed.

![1-PSDR_Definitions](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/1-PSDR_Definitions.png)

 
### Section II: Primary Partner Quote Data (Closed-Won Order Data)*

- **Partner Track**: Either Select or Open based off of the resale partner
- **Distributor**: The GitLab-authorized distributor that transacts according to the primary quote:
- **Deal Type**:
  - _MSP_: The partner purchases _and owns_ the license on behalf of the customer.
  - _Resale_: The partner is actually transacting the deal on their paper.

![2-Primary_Quote_Definitions](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/2-Primary_Quote_Definitions.png)
 
### Section III: Partner Contribution Data
- **Influence Partner**: Other partners, generally SI/GSIs or alliance partners, that have helped influence a deal but are not part of the actual transaction
- **Influence Partner**: Other partners, generally SI/GSIs or alliance partners, that have
- **Platform Partner**:  Customer's platform that GitLab is being deployed.

![3-Partner_Contribution_Definitions](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/3-Partner_Contribution_Definitions.png)
 
### Services Resale
- Partners can earn a program discount for reselling GitLab Professional Services
 
### Incumbency Renewals
- Incumbent partners qualify for program renewal discounts. The partners that transact the most recent sale are considered the incumbent.
- A different partner can earn an incumbency discount only through formal written communications from the customer. This can be provided via email from an authorized representative from the customer.
- To earn partner discounts, partners will be required to meet compliance requirements (i.e. in good credit standing, have provided quarterly updates on the customer, review within 30 days of renewal, etc).
- GitLab Sales must work with incumbent channel partners on renewals unless the customer documents in writing that they no longer want to work with the partner.  GitLab cannot offer a direct renewal quote if there is an incumbent partner.
 
### Tender Offers
- Tender offers are ones where the customers are requesting multiple bids for a project.
- Since all partners would be engaged in the sales process and would be creating a bid, all partners qualify for the Partner Co-Sell discount. However, if a partner was early in with the customer (pre-tender) and sourced the deal, then they could receive the higher discount with an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration. If the partner earning the Partner Sourced discount is not awarded the deal, they would not receive additional referral compensation. Any partner offering their own services would qualify for Service Attach incentives in addition to any sales discounts for which they would qualify. The exception to the above would be for:
  - US PubSec business: In the event there is an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration on a tender offer, the rest of the partners bidding would receive MSRP (List Price).
  - Renewals: Incumbent resellers get last year's discount, all other resellers get MSRP (List Price) for flat renewals. Renewal add-ons for all resellers can receive program discounts based on Deal Registration Status.
 
### Program Compliance
- For partners to transact according to program discounts, they must agree to the GitLab Partner Agreement.
- To earn partner discounts, partners are required to be program compliant.
- Non-contracted partners may transact on a one-off basis, only with explicit approval of regional channel directors, the director of channel programs, or the vice president of channels.
 
## Unauthorized Partners
- An authorized partner is a partner that has signed a contract to transact with GitLab. In SFDC, the "Partner Status" will say "Authorized," there will be a date in the "Signed Contract Date" field, and _either_ the "Click-Through Agreement" box will be checked, or a manual contract will be listed in the Google docs or Contract section of the account record. 
- A key goal of the GitLab Channel Program is the success of our authorized partners, which means whenever possible, we should work deals with them. We are developing our channel to provide coverage across geos, customer segments and vertical markets. However, there are some situations where customer requires a deal be transacted by a partner that is not willing to join the GitLab Partner Program. Only in those situations should we transact with an unauthorized partner, and only with the explicit approval of the programs team.  
- Unauthorized partners have not signed a GitLab Partner Agreement.
- If an unauthorized partner would like to transact GitLab products or services, please have them visit the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/) to sign up. Someone who has authority to accept the Agreement is required.
- Unauthorized partners cannot transact GitLab products and/or services, unless rare but explicit approval is granted by the programs team. Please reach out to the #channel-programs-ops Slack channel.

### Legal Requests for Partner Contracts

The process to request the [legal team’s involvement in partner contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#to-request-a-legal-review-for-a-channel-partner-contract) can be found on the legal team’s handbook page. Please note that the process for getting partner contracts signed is different from the [process for any other legal request](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/customer-negotiations/#how-to-reach-legal).

 
## Channel Reporting and Tagging
![4-Ch_Reporting_Tagging](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/4-Ch_Reporting_Tagging.png)
 
### Definitions
1. **Deal Path**: How the deal is transacted. Values can be Channel, Direct, or Web. Includes Referral Ops for Channel.
2. **Partner Sourced Deal Reg**: Partner submits a Registration for their sourced opportunity via the Partner Portal. For the purposes of this matrix the assumption is the Deal Reg is approved. If the deal is not Partner Sourced then Deal Reg does not apply.
3. **Initial Source**: SFDC Lead value that is populated based on lead source. Will default to CQL (Channel Qualified Lead) when a Partner submits a Partner Sourced Deal Reg and an Opportunity does not already exist in the system.
4. **SQS (Sales Qualified Sourced)**: Who converts/creates the Opportunity in SFDC. Can only be 1 value
5. **Deal Type**: Whether or not the partner is taking paper or not
6. **Order Type**: Customer order designation in SFDC. New First Order or Growth
 
 
### Use Cases
- **Numbers 1 & 4**
  - Channel Partner submits Partner Sourced Deal Reg and no Opportunity exists in the system. Therefore, the Initial source is CQL and SQS defaults to Channel Generated.
  - This applies to both New and Growth orders
- **Number 2**
  - Channel submits an order for a deal that we did not have an opportunity in the system for but did not submit a Partner Sourced Deal Reg
- **Number 3**
  - Deal is transacting thru the channel but it was sourced by either a GitLab AE or SDR
- ***Exception***
  - AE or SDR creates an opportunity prior to a valid Partner Sourced Deal Reg being submitted and approved. *If the Deal Registration is approved the opportinity will automatically update SQS = Channel Generated when the approved Deal Registration has been approved and linked. 
 
### Default Logic
1. If `Partner Sourced Deal Reg = True` and no opportunity exists, then `Initial Source = CQL` > `SQS = Channel Generated`
2. Alliances and OEM Logic: No Deal Registration applied but if `Initial Source = CQL` then
`SQS = Channel Generated`
 
### SFDC Opportunity Source Field Values for Channel
- **Initial Source**:
  - _Channel Qualified Lead (CQL)_: GitLab Channel Partner created and/or qualified the Lead whether they sourced it themselves or GitLab provided the inquiry to them to work.
- **Sales Qualified Source**:
  - _Channel_: The Channel Partner has converted the Lead/CQL to a qualified opportunity, or has created a brand new opportunity without a prior lead being in the system. This field defaults to Channel when `Initial Source = CQL`.
- **DR - Deal Engagement**:
  - _Partner Sourced_: Partner has either found the original opportunity or an upsell to a current customer. If the `Initial Source  = Channel Qualified Lead` or `Sales Qualified Source = Channel Generated`, then the deal is Partner Sourced.
*Please visit the [Marketing Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/#initial-source) for Intial Source definition and context.
 
 
## Managing Partner Opportunities
[Partner Co-Sell (Resale)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-co-sell) | Partner Sourced Deal Registration: [Resale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities) | [MSP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities) | [Referral](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-referral-opportunities) 
 
In order to transact with GitLab, a partner must both be authorized by GitLab, and have completed at least one sales training.
 
### Partner Co-Sell
All Channel deals are considered Partner Co-Sell opportunities unless there is an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration or the Opportunities Sales Qualified Source = Channel Generated. These opportunities are not sourced solely by a partner, but highlight the relationship between GitLab and partners in the selling process. Partner Co-Sell deals do not require the partner to submit a deal registration, and should be processed according to standard Partner Co-Sell discounts as identified in the [GitLab Partner Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/).

### US Public Sector Preferred Partner Co-Sell Request Process

The Partner Sourced Deal Registration process is the same for commercial and US Pubsec business. The instructions below apply _only_ to US Public Sector CoSell opportunities.

1. Each public sector partner is provided a link to a Google form by either the SAL, ISR, or Channel Manager. This form must be completed in order for a partner to receive Preferred Partner Co-Sell discounts.
2. When a partner becomes aware of an opportunity, they must fill in the Google form, which will timestamp all of the relevant data to a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cd5xEDdfiiyMW81oykv6Gq58nG1kn3Sxz9h7adY1o8U/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Part of filling out the Google form requires the partner to input the name and email of the SAL with whom they’ve discussed this. When that email address is inputted into the form and the form is submitted, that SAL will receive notification of a Pubsec Co-Sell opportunity.
4. The SAL will then approve or deny the submission based on Handbook guidelines. 
   - The business reason for accepting a preferred partner submission must be noted on the Google form. 
   - The SAL’s approval or denial will be time stamped in the Google sheet.
5. Once a partner is approved and selected, the 18-digit opportunity ID will be shared with them.
6. If a partner was previously approved but is now being removed, that SAL can selected the “Removed” option and enter the partner’s email address to notify them   

All submissions will be recorded and tracked for audit purposes. The chosen preferred partner should match the Resale Partner on the quote with the Partner Co-Sell discount.    

Any other partner receiving a quote for the same opportunity will be provided MSRP.    

Further enablement for GitLab Team Members is available. For further information, contact the #channel-programs-ops slack channel.   


### Guidelines for approving US Public Sector Co-Sell Partner Submissions

The following are explicit guidelines for approved US Public Sector Partners to receive preferred pricing on Gitlab-sourced opportunities.   

Partner Requirements:
- Must be an approved US Public Sector Partner, [authorized to transact with GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#standard-channel-practices)   
- The partner must have completed one meeting with the SAL for the opportunity
   -This meeting must have included a conversation about alignment of how we can work together to land with vision and expand with purpose 
- The partner must have filled out the Public Sector Co-Sell form and include the 18-digit Opportunity ID provided by the SAL

 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration
There are three types of Partner Sourced Deal Registrations within the GitLab Partner Program. For step-by-step instructions on how to process each of these opportunities, see the specific sections: [Resale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities), [MSP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities), and [Referral](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-referral-opportunities) .
 
The Partner Sourced Deal Registration program not only rewards partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab, but also rewards partners for selling their own services into the customer account.
 
Channel Managers are responsible for reviewing Partner Sourced Deal Registrations and must either approve, deny, or return the registration for additional information. It is recommended that the Channel Manager communicate with the applicable GitLab Sales Team Member during this process.
 
**The SLA for GitLab to respond to partners on a Partner Sourced Deal Registration is two business days. There must be contact with the registering partner within two business days, whether it be approval, denial, or a request for more information.** 
 
While multiple partners can submit a deal registration for an opportunity, only one Partner Sourced Deal Registration can be approved for a specific opportunity. As a reminder, Partner Sourced Deal Registrations are opportunity-based and partners cannot register an account.
 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: What to Expect
To view individual processing steps for each type of Partner Sourced Deal Registration Opportunity, click the appropriate type of deal: Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for [Resale](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-resale-opportunities) | [MSP](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-msp-opportunities) | [Referral](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#partner-sourced-deal-registration-referral-opportunities).  

_Note: The Partner Portal is hosted by Impartner and has SSO enabled with Vartopia, the partner-facing Deal Registration system. GitLab uses a third-party managed services team to help manage administrative processes for Deal Registration._. 

GitLab has three Deal Registration programs: Partner Sourced Deal Registration for resale opportunities, MSP Deal Registration for partners providing their own managed services, and Referral Deal Registrations for partners who do not transact the business they bring to GitLab.
 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: How it Works
When a partner submits a Partner Sourced Deal Registration, the Managed Services team will handle the initial submission. Upon record creation, the following occurs:
1. An email is sent to the partner acknowledging that the deal registration has been successfully created. The registration is also viewable in the deal registration section of the partner’s portal account.
2. The system notifies the Managed Services team to review the registration.
3. The system creates a SFDC record on the registration object that includes all of the details of the registration.  

The Managed Services team will evaluate the registration, link it to the appropriate customer account and contact in SFDC, and then send an email to the applicable Channel Manager to approve/deny the registration.  

By default, the Channel Manager is assigned as the Account Owner in the Partner Account in SFDC. GitLab’s Managed Services team will manually reassign the registration to the correct owner in cases where there may be more than one owner due to segment or territory. There is a 4 hour SLA for the Managed Services team once the Deal Registration has been submitted by the Partner.  

Once a Channel Manager is assigned a Partner Sourced Deal Registration, they receive an email notification. Channel Managers can also view the registrations in their list view within the SFDC Registration tab. To view the details of the Registration they can either click on the link in the email or the specific record in the Registration view in SFDC.
 
### Rules of Engagement for Partner Sourced Deal Registration
- To receive a quote with a Partner Sourced discount, they must complete a deal registration for the opportunity and it must be approved by a GitLab Team Member.
- Only one partner can earn a Partner Sourced Deal Registration discount per opportunity. Partners, other than the partner granted the deal registration discount, will receive the Partner Co-Sell discount rate. Deal registration approval is based upon order of receipt of the registration, qualification of the opportunity, partner ability to deliver in-country/region support, and partner relationship with the customer. Final deal registration approval decision will be made by GitLab Channel after discussion with GitLab Sales.
- Approved deal registrations have a standard 90-day expiration from the date of original approval. (Deal Registration extensions beyond the initial 90 days approval are at the sole discretion of GitLab). To grant a standard 30-day extension, click the “Extend DR 30 Days” button. For non-standard extensions beyond 30 days, please chatter @Partner Operations on the registration record and provide the date that the registration should expire.
 
![5-Extend_DR](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/5-Extend_DR.png)
 
- GitLab collaborates with partners holding the approved deal registration and is available to support partners throughout the entire sales process.
- In the event the engagement is dissolved, the GitLab Sales Rep will generally notify the partner by phone or email. GitLab will reconsider other qualified deal registrations submitted for this deal, in chronological order of submission. If there are no other registration requests submitted, the GitLab sales rep will typically initiate engagement with a reseller of the GitLab sales rep’s choosing. 
 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration System Status and Information
- Deal Registration details will never override any information that the sales team forecasts on the Opportunity.
- There is a Deal Registration ID that can be used to track all Deal Registrations in the system.
- All Deal Registrations are individual objects in SFDC under Registrations. They do not come in as leads.

### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: Resale Opportunities
Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for resale opportunities reward partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab. With an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration, a partner will receive a deeper discount than Partner Co-Sell opportunities, according to the [GitLab Partner Program(https://handbook/resellers/).
 
To process a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for a resale opportunity, follow the steps below:
 
1. Click the link in either the email or the [Deal Registration Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aUal) to open the registration object in Salesforce.
2. Check to make sure that the Partner Sourced Deal Registration type says resale.
3. Click “Link/Create Opportunity.”
   ![9-Link_Create_Opp](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/9-Link_Create_Opp.png)

4. On the Link/Create Opportunity page, first search for the opportunity in the provided list and/or by doing a “Global Search.”
  - **If the opportunity exists**, click “Select” next to the opportunity name. You will then be brought back to the deal registration record.
   ![6-Link_Opportunity_Select](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/6-Link_Opportunity_Select.png)
  - **If there is no matching opportunity**, click “Create New,” and then choose “Standard” in the Opportunity Type. The system will then populate all the necessary fields, including the DR-mapped fields. Click “Save” and you will be brought back to the registration record.  
5. Click Approve/Deny/Return Registration.
   ![7-Approve_Deny_Return](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/7-Approve_Deny_Return.png)
6. On the next page, choose approve, and if you have a message for the partner about the deal, you can add that into the “comments” section. This is not required, but anything included in this field will be sent back to the partner.
   ![8-Approve_Deny_Details.png](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/8-Approve_Deny_Details.png)
   - If a distributor is involved, choose the distributor in the field that appears. If no distributor is involved, this field can be left blank.
   - Both the registration record and the opportunity record will be updated with the approval information.
7. If you created a new opportunity during this process (see step 4 above), `Opportunity Owner` will need to be updated:
  - If the customer account is assigned to a SAL/AE, update `Opportunity Owner` to the SAL/AE who owns the customer account using the Change Opportunity Owner button; or,
  - If the customer account is not yet assigned to a SAL/AE, chatter @sales-support and request that `Opportunity Owner` and customer account be assigned to a SAL/AE.
8. For quotes going through distribution, please chatter @PartnerOperations with all the information for quote creation.
  - The deal registration form is not a quoting tool and will not have all the information needed to create the quote. You must get this information from the partner or elsewhere before requesting the quote.
 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: MSP Opportunities
Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for MSP opportunities reward partners for managing products and services for their customers accounts. With an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration for MSP, a partner will receive a different discount than other resale opportunities, according to the [GitLab Partner Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/). 
 
A Managed Service Provider (MSP) purchases licenses on behalf of an end user. The MSP will be the owner and manager of the licenses but their customer, the end user, is the one using the licenses. This creates specific needs in GitLab Salesforce opportunities to ensure proper reporting and compensation. _Please note that the steps for an MSP opportunity differ from the steps for a resale opportunity._
 
To process a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for an MSP opportunity, Channel Account Manager should follow the steps below:
 
1. Click the link in either the email or the [Deal Registration Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aUal) to open the registration object in Salesforce.
2. Check to make sure that the Partner Sourced Deal Registration type says MSP.
3. Click “Link/Create Opportunity.”

   - **If the opportunity exists**, click “Select” next to the opportunity name. You will then be brought back to the deal registration record.
   ![6-Link_Opportunity_Select](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/6-Link_Opportunity_Select.png)
   - **If there is no matching opportunity**, click “Create New,” and then choose “Standard” in the Opportunity Type. The system will then populate all the necessary fields, including the DR-mapped fields. Click “Save” and you will be brought back to the registration record.

   ![8-Approve_Deny_Details.png](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/8-Approve_Deny_Details.png)
   - Distributor field should be left blank as MSP opportunities are direct between MSP partner and GitLab.
   - Both the registration record and the opportunity record will be updated with the approval information.
6. Manually change the `Account Name` field to the partner account. This should **not** be the MSP End User (i.e., customer) account.
7. If you created a new opportunity during this process (see step 4 above), `Opportunity Owner` will need to be updated:
  - If the MSP End User account is assigned to a SAL/AE, update `Opportunity Owner` to the SAL/AE who owns the MSP End User account using the Change Opportunity Owner button; or,
  - If the MSP End User account is not yet assigned to a SAL/AE, chatter @sales-support and request that `Opportunity Owner` and MSP End User (i.e., customer) account be assigned to a SAL/AE.
8. Connect the GitLab Sales Rep to the MSP Partner Rep so they can discuss and align on opportunity and quote details.
9. Provide [Deal Desk MSP quoting](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#msp-quotes) and [internal Partner Program discounting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiT_2EsnL20c4w0hyZ_CGaJQIzj8CSCsHERoR80cwws/edit?usp=sharing) guideline links to the GitLab Sales Rep so they have the details necessary to create a quote.

_The deal registration form is not a quoting tool and will not have all the information needed to create the quote. You must get this information from the partner or elsewhere before requesting the quote._
 
### Partner Sourced Deal Registration: Referral Opportunities
Partner Sourced Deal Registrations for referral opportunities reward partners for bringing net-new business to GitLab, even if that partner does not transact the deal. With an approved Partner Sourced Deal Registration for a referral, a partner will receive a **back-end rebate**, processed quarterly, according to the [GitLab Partner Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/).
 
To process a Partner Sourced Deal Registration for a referral opportunity, follow the steps:

## Service Attach Opportunities
GitLab incentivizes partners that sell their own professional services into a customer environment at the time of a GitLab product sale. To be eligible for this back-end rebate, the partner needs to submit a Service Attached Deal Registration that is approved by a GitLab Channel Manager. This is separate from the Partner Sourced Deal Registration for the license sale. 

To track the Partner Services, the partner must register the deal on the [partner portal](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/#gitlab-partner-portal).  

When a Channel Manager either receives an email alert, or sees a new registration in the [Deal Registration Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aUal), the following steps should be taken:
 
1. Click the link in either the email or the [Deal Registration Report](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aUal) to open the registration object in Salesforce.
2. Check to make sure that there is a Service Attach Type in the Service Attach Type field.
   - Note that there could likely be another Partner Sourced Deal Registration for the license resale opportunity. The resale registration will populate in the opportunity fields, while the Service Attach registration will only be linked to the opportunity. 
   - A Service Attach Deal Registration MUST attach to a license sale opportunity. There will almost always be an opportunity in the system, and it is best practice for a Channel Manager to process the Partner Sourced Deal Registration first, if there is one, before processing the Service Attach Deal Registration.
3. Discuss the opportunity with the appropriate AE/SAL and decide to either approve or deny the registration(s).
4. Click “Link/Create Opportunity.”
   ![9-Link_Create_Opp](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/9-Link_Create_Opp.png)
5. On the Link/Create Opportunity page, first search for the opportunity in the provided list and/or by doing a “Global Search.”
   - **If the opportunity exists**, click “Select” next to the opportunity name. You will then be brought back to the deal registration record.
   ![6-Link_Opportunity_Select](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/6-Link_Opportunity_Select.png)
   - **If there is no matching opportunity**, click “Create New,” and then choose “Standard” in the Opportunity Type. The system will then populate all the necessary fields, including the DR-mapped fields. Click “Save” and you will be brought back to the registration record.
   - **The opportunity must be either new or no older than 6 months old to qualify for the incentive.** If the appropriate opportunity is older than 6 months old, the Channel Manager should deny the registration and work with the partner to see if there is an upcoming licensing opportunity that would make sense for the services.
6. Click Approve/Deny/Return Registration.
   ![7-Approve_Deny_Return](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/7-Approve_Deny_Return.png)
   - The following steps consider the registration _approved_.
7. On the next page, choose approve, and if you have a message for the partner about the deal, you can add that into the “comments” section. This is not required, but anything included in this field will be sent back to the partner.
   ![8-Approve_Deny_Details](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/8-Approve_Deny_Details.png)
   - If a distributor is involved, choose the distributor in the field that appears. If no distributor is involved, this field can be left blank.
8. Both the registration record and the opportunity record will be updated with the approval information.
   - A Service Attach registration will **not** populate the Partner Sourced Deal Registration section of an opportunity. To find the Service Attach Deal Registration, click the related list link at the top of the opportunity. This will bring you to a list of any registration attached to the opportunity, including the Service Attach Deal Registration.
   ![10-Reg_Related_Lists](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/10-Reg_Related_Lists.png)  
   - Alternatively, you can scroll to the “Registrations” section toward the bottom of the opportunity.
   ![11-Reg_for_Svc_Att](/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/images/11-Reg_for_Svc_Att.png)  
9. If you have created a new opportunity during this process, chatter @sales-support and request that the opportunity owner be updated to the name of the sales team member who owns the customer account.
10. Partner delivers services, either before, during, or after the license sale completes.
   - The services can be completed up to six months before the resale opportunity closes, or up to six months after the resale opportunity closes. Services delivered more than six months before or after the resale opportunity closes do not qualify for the Service Attach Rebate. 
11. The Partner goes through the Proof of Execution process:
   - The partner sends the Proof of Execution (POE), customer signed statement of work (SOW), or other customer-verified proof of execution to `Partnersupport@gitlab.com`.
   - The partner completes the [POE form](https://forms.gle/1AXbStjZCKuWecTf7).
12. The Partner Help Desk will ensure the Deal ID is listed on the POE, upload it to the opportunity, and chatter the Channel Manager. The Partner Help Desk will then update the Service Attach Deal Registration Status to Closed-Won.
13. After the close of quarter in which the resale deal is closed-won*, Channel Operations will pull a report of Closed-Won Service Attach Deal Registrations for rebate payments. Channel Operations sends the report to Partner Help Desk.
14. Partner Help Desk submits the payments to Coupa for reseller payouts. Resellers should receive payment within 45 days of the start of the new quarter.

 
Rebate payouts will be reported and paid after each GitLab quarter close.
 
### Additional Information
- The resale discount will be administered as an upfront discount from the GitLab license price on the most recent product sale net license price. The Service Attach incentive will be paid out at the end of each GitLab fiscal quarter.
- Partner Service Attach incentives are as follows:
  - 1-3 Service attach deliveries in a quarter: 3% rebate on license net ARR up to $2,500
  - 4+ Service attach deliveries in a quarter:  6% rebate on license net ARR up to $5,000
  - Total cap is $25,000 per partner per quarter
- Partners must register a Services Attach deal registration and provide proof of performance/execution to qualify for the incentive.
- Rebates and referral fees may require CRO approval. 
- Discounts are off list price.  If GitLab is deeply discounting a large ARR customer engagement, the partner can reasonably expect to share in that with a discount reduction.  The Partner, GitLab Sales, Channel Account Manager must agree on the negotiated discount amount.
 
For more information on quoting or the Partner Program, please visit:
- [Deal Desk Quote Configuration](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#zuora-quote-configuration-guide---standard-quotes)
- [Partner Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/)
- [Channel Discount Matrices for GitLab Team Members](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qiT_2EsnL20c4w0hyZ_CGaJQIzj8CSCsHERoR80cwws/edit?usp=sharing).  

## Channel Approvals
Channel Approvers for opportunities are based on the Opportunity Owner’s User Region. Whenever an approver changes, an [issue must be opened with Sales Systems](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) to replace the old approver with the new. Current channel approvers can be seen in our [channel approver matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CH-uH_zr0qaVaV1QbmVZ1rF669DsaUeq9w-q1QiKPE/edit#heading=h.jxrpmpixprez). 

If an approver will not be able to approve opportunities due to PTO or some other reason, they must [assign a delegate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#reassign-quote-approvals) in SFDC to approve opportunities on their behalf. 

## Letters of Authorization
When a partner needs a Letter of Authorization, they must log into the partner portal and request one from the “Letter of Authorization” button along the top of the page. If a partner does not log in to the portal, they will not be able to access this request, ensuring that only authorized partners can access the link. 

The partner will be prompted to input basic company information that will auto-fill the letter of authorization. When they click submit, an email will be sent to the Partner Help Desk, who will need to validate that the partner is authorized, and then click the “approve” button in the email. 

Upon approval, the letter of authorization will be automatically sent to the legal team who will approve and initial the letter before sending it to GitLab's PAO for signature. Once signed, the letter of authorization will be sent directly to the partner via email. The letter is good for one calendar year from the date on the letter. 


## Partner Help Desk Support and Communication
 
**Internal Team Members:** Chatter @Partner Help Desk in Salesforce or for general questions, post in the Slack channel #channel-programs-ops. Please review [Working with Partner Help Desk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tT5xcx04mlFyuftL5ECPH1VCZ0pkhW7caqnCkM7a-Ro/edit#slide=id.p1). 

**External Communication:** Email partnersupport@gitlab.com to include a partner or other external stakeholder for help with partner-related requests. PHD team members monitor the queue and email inbox throughout the day in all time zones.  

Partner Help Desk’s primary internal communication channel is the #channel-programs-ops Slack channel. For help with specific partner account records in Salesforce, please chatter @Partner Help Desk. This will automatically create a case in the Partner Help Desk (PHD) queue.  

**Please do not tag PHD team members directly in chatter or make a request through Slack direct message. Always use @Partner Help Desk for SFDC requests or post in #channel-programs-ops in Slack for general questions.**. This ensures our team is working as efficiently as possible for everyone and that you are covered in case the team member who replied first becomes unavailable.
If someone is working on a case, they will continue to support until the case is closed. If a matter was resolved, but needs to be revisited, please chatter @Partner Help Desk to reopen a case.
To Chatter the PHD team, tag @Partner Help Desk in Chatter on the related opportunity or account page and a short sentence on your request. If the PHD team needs more information or needs to pull in another team, we will follow up directly via Chatter. If you need to involve a partner, please email partnersupport@gitlab.com, instead of an individual PHD team member so any team member can jump in as something moves forward.

## Channel Partner Price Files
The following price files are provided by Channel Ops in Google Sheet, Excel, and PDF format:
- **Distribution Price Files** for Resale Opportunities, including reseller and distributor discounts for the main program.
- **Public Sector Price Files** for Resale Opportunities, including reseller and distributor discounts for the main program.
- **Partner (Direct Reseller) Price Files** for Resale Opportunities, including reseller discounts for the main program.
- **List Price File** with no discounts.

### How to Access the Price Files (Partners)

Distributor and Reseller partners can access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/) for the current GitLab Price File. If you have any issues accessing the Partner Portal, please contact the Partner Help Desk team at [partnersupport@gmail.com](mailto:partnersupport@gmail.com).

### How to Access and Share the Price Files (GitLab Team Member)

Price Files can be found [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pouTUH1BHNQjKt-lNsIEu5IQppIRinbg).

Only Channel Managers should be sharing Channel Price Files. 

When sharing a Channel Price File with a partner (either a distributor or reseller), please do NOT share the folder or file location. To share a document, please either copy it into your own google drive and update the permissions accordingly when you share a link, or download a copy and email to a partner. No partners should be given access to this folder. 
 
### Naming Conventions and Which File to Use
 
Within the Price List Folder, there are other folders. For the current active price file, always use the one with the most recent date that has not passed yet. The folder name will also say [ACTIVE] at the front of it. 

For example: 
If there are three folders within the Price List Folder. One is dated two months ago, and one is dated for one month in the future. The one dated two months ago says [ACTIVE] in front of the file name. 

The file dated two months ago is the one currently in use with our partners. For current questions and quoting purposes, this is the file that should be used. 

The file dated one month in the future is the file that should be provided to partners (especially distributors) to set up their systems. It will go into effect on the date in the file name. 

If there are any questions, please reach out to the #channel-programs-ops Slack channel. 

## Price File Update Process

At the beginning of the [second month of every quarter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year), Channel Operations will create an issue and reach out to product and professional services (PS) departments to collect information on any new changes, additions, or discontinuations of part numbers. It is the **responsibility of the product/PS departments** to provide any and all information about SKUs that will be active on the first date of the next quarter. 

Once the price book is updated, Channel Operations will tag the product and professional services team to check to make sure the information is up-to-date before publishing. The due date for this approval is five (5) business days before the end of the second month of a given quarter.*

The following departments/people will be tagged for gathering this information:

* **Professional Services** - Bryan May, Brian Will 
* **Channel Services** - Boughty Canton
* **Product/Finance** -  Brian Wong 

The following departments/people will be tagged for FYI/Additional Input:

* **Partner Operations:** Colleen Farris, Nick Scala, Niles Jamshaid
* **Channel Programs**: Evon Collett, Kim Jaegar
* **Deal Desk**: Jesse Rabbits
* **PubSec Channel**: Pilar Meija

After all product approvals are complete, Channel Operations will request approval in the same issue from the following Channel Teams/Individuals:

* **Channel & Alliances**: Colleen Farris
* **Programs:** Ed Cepulis
* **Public Sector**: Chris Novello

Please reach out to the #channel-programs-ops Slack channel for assistance. 

*Exceptions can be made for updates to core GitLab products (Ultimate and Premium)

### Internal Price File Communications

Channel Operations will post a message on the slack channel #partner-fyi to share the updated Price Files and call out any major changes. 

### External Price File Communications

Updated Price Files will be uploaded to the Partner Portal approximately 30 days before the upcoming fiscal quarter. 

Channel Operations will share a copy of the pricelists to the main contacts of each distributor and work with the distributor to ensure any applicable contract vehicles are updated (e.g., Public Sector contracts).

## SFDC Channel Manager Activity Tracker

### Opportunity Tagging for Marketplace Deals
***Use Case 1: Partner Co-Sell (Marketplace transaction with no source credit)*** 

If a deal is being transacted through **GCP Marketplace** or **AWS Marketplace**, then the following fields need to be filled out on the opportunity:
- **Resale Partner** = [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks)* or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt)*  
_*Be sure to use the correct SFDC account. Click on the link to confirm the GCP and/or AWS account.)_  
 
***Use Case 2: Partner Sourced Deal Registration (No Marketplace transaction)***  

If GCP or AWS brought us a lead/referred GitLab a deal, but will not be transacting on Marketplace, then the following fields should be filled out on the opportunity:
- **DR - Partner** should be filled out using [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks) or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt) account
- **DR - Partner Deal Type** = Referral

- **DR - Partner Deal Type** = Resale 
 
***Use Case 4: Partner Influence (No Marketplace transaction and no source credit)***

If GCP or AWS support a deal and help drive the customer to buy GitLab, but were not the original source of the opportunity nor are they transacting the deal, then the following field should be filled out on the Opportunity:
- **Influence Partner** should be filled out using [GCP](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001nJhks) or [AWS](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/0014M00001ldTdt) account

### Quote Tagging for Marketplace Deals
 - If a deal is being transacted through the **Google Cloud Marketplace**, use the following values in the quote:
   - Invoice Owner = Google Cloud Marketplace 
   - Invoice Owner Contact = Cloud Marketplace Payments
         _Note: search “Payments” (with quotation marks) for the correct contact to populate in this field)_
   - Resale Partner = Google Cloud (Partner)
 - If a deal is being transacted through the **Amazon Web Services Marketplace**, use the following values in the quote: 
   - Invoice Owner = Amazon Web Services, Inc. 
   - Invoice Owner Contact = Accounts Payable (AWS) 
   - Resale Partner = Amazon Web Services

### Marketplace Transaction Fees
Deals booked through the Amazon and Google markeplaces use the fee schedules as shown in the [Deal Approval Matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CH-uH_zr0qaVaV1QbmVZ1rF669DsaUeq9w-q1QiKPE/edit#bookmark=kix.16z0a5v6j1e2).

### Requesting Google Cloud Credits
Required fields when requesting Google Cloud Credits on an Opportunity
1. Have you engaged with the GCP Team already? (Drop down: Yes, No)
2. Customer open to being a reference? (drop down: logo use, case-study, joint speaking session, etc.)
3. Credits being requested (Sales Rep enters in the amount of credits required to close the deal)
Once all required information is submitted, the request  will be routed internally for approval. If approved, the opportunity is updated to ‘approved’ and the opportunity owner  is notified via email. GCP Credits are provided directly to the customer by the GCP Team after acceptance of the private offer. For more information, visit the [Private Alliance Handbook](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/alliances/alliances-internal/gcp/).

## Compensation on Channel Opportunities
 
The executed compensation letter should be the approved and legal source of truth for compensation. However please use the following resources to assist in clarification or exceptions.

### Channel Neutral
Comp Neutrality applies to all GitLab Opportunities where a Partner is involved in the physical transaction (takes paper) ***and*** a Partner Program discount is applied on the executed Partner Order Form.
The maximum Comp Neutral payout is based on the applicable GitLab Partner Program discount matrix. If additional discount is needed in order to close the deal, that portion is not eligible for Comp Neutrality.
In the event a lesser discount is applied on the deal then what the Partner Program allocates, then the lesser discount will also be what is calculated for Comp Neutrality.
Other factors:
- Starter/Bronze is not applicable even if a discount is approved
- US PubSec Sales, Channel, and Alliances do not qualify
- For Alliances, the contractual discount is used to calculate comp neutral
- IBM OEM deals do not qualify
- For H1 FY22 comp neutral did not apply for Distribution discounts. Starting H2 FY22 the contractual Distribution discounts will apply however no retroactive payments/re-calculations will be made.
As a reminder, comp neutrality only applies to comp and does not retire quota. For additional information, please review [Channel Neutral Compensation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/commissions/#channel-neutral-compensation) within the Sales Ops commission section of the Handbook.
Internal: [Partner Program Discount Matrix](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#program-and-incentive-definitions)
For Partner Program discounts specific to US PubSec, please reach out to #channel-ops on Slack.
 
### 2-Tier Opportunities
If the Opportunity is going through a 2-Tier Channel (Distributor + Reseller), both Partner Accounts must be included on the Opportunity in the Partner Information section in order for both Program discounts to apply AND for Comp Neutral to calculate on both. Reseller should be in the Partner  field and the applicable Distributor in the Distributor field on the Opportunity.
 
### Opportunities with GCP and AWS
For deals going through GCP and AWS, the Partner fields should still be filled out on the Opportunity but comp neutral will not calculate until the deal closes as partner discounts are done after the quote/order form is generated. Deal Desk will assist with this process.
