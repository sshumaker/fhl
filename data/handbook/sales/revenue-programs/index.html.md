## Overview
The purpose of GitLab's Revenue Program is to improve the quantity of opportunities and closed business with defined, cross-functional sales motions to ultimately generate more ARR for GitLab.  This objective is achieved through a managed series of coordinated, cross-functional activities to address a specific pipeline gap with a specific pipeline goal, over a set period of time.

### How to Generate More ARR

- **Increase Deal Sizes** - Efforts focus on understanding client buying and expansion behaviors in order to optimize individual sales cycles.
- **Improve the Velocity and Accuracy in Closing Deals** - Efforts focus on enabling the CRO teams with the skills needed to undercover customer pain points, conduct discoveries, create value for the customer and close business with greater efficiency.
