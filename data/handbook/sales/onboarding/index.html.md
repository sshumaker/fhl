## The Goals of Sales Quick Start
Onboarding for Field Team Members at GitLab is a blended learning experience (virtual, self-paced learning path paired with an immersive, hands-on in-person workshop called Sales Quick Start) focused on what new field team members need to **KNOW**, **DO**, and **BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE** within their first 30 days or so on the job so they are "customer conversation ready" and they are comfortable, competent, and confident leading customer engagements before the end of their first several weeks on the job. There are some formal learning components with a heavy emphasis on social learning (learning from others) and learning by doing to help bridge the knowing-going gap.

## Role-Based Onboarding 

To accelerate ramp time and to support the GitLab values of results, iteration and efficiency, we have optimized the field onboarding program to provide new team members with the core information and essential competencies paired with the day-to-day skills that they need to be successful in their individual role. Learning is combined with specialized on the job training and a more robust shadowing program to ensure that new team members can contextualize and apply what they are learning throughout the entire onboarding journey. 

The onboarding program includes individual role-based learning journeys for AEs, SALs, SAs, CSMs, CAMs, ABDMs and ISRs. Each role-based learning journey is designed based on the unique needs of each segment and includes the following milestones: 

* Month 1: Understand role and GitLab product (SQS & Pre-work)
* Month 2: Meet customers
* Month 3: Become customer-ready certified
* Month 4: Close first deals
* Month 5 and Beyond: Continue to develop intermediate and advanced skills

### Learning Journeys
