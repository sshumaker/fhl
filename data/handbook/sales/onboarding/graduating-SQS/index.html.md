## Graduating from Sales Onboarding
In order to officially “graduate” from Sales Onboarding at GitLab and be awarded the [Sales Quick Start - Core Curriculum badge](https://gitlab.badgr.com/public/badges/4zi-duhsTHG-jtWFYVgGRQ), we have identified a few components that are considered milestones of achievement (many of these must be done concurrently to ensure completion): 

#### Sales, Customer Success and SDR Roles:
*  Complete [Sales Quick Start learning path in LevelUp](https://levelup.gitlab.com/courses/sales-quick-start) prior to the SQS Workshop (at least 80% completion required, though 100% is preferred). The Sales Quick Start pre-work is an 8 hour time commitment consisting of 16 action items.
   * 9 eLearning Courses
   * 7 Quizzes (Total of 60 multiple choice questions) 
   * 4 Free Response Questions 
   * 3 Coffee Chats 
   * 2 Surveys (Pre & Post Workshop)
*  The [Sales Quick Start Workshop](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/onboarding/SQS-workshop/#sqs-remote-agenda) is a 16 hour time commitment consisting of 12 instructor led trainings including Command of the Message, our value based selling methodology, with 4 hands on group activities.
   * Command of the Message - (6 hours)
   * MEDDPPICC - (1 hour 30 minutes)
   * No Tissues for Issues + Product Tiering - (50 minutes) 
   * Introduction to the Competiton - (50 minutes)
   * Alliances - (50 minutes)
   * Channel - (50 minutes)
   * Legal / Deal Desk - (40 minutes)
   * Professional Services - (50 minutes)
   * Field Security - (30 minutes)
   * Mock Calls - (4 hours) 
*  Complete 1 mock discovery call at the SQS Workshop with a PMM, Manager, or a more experienced SA or CSM
   *  Articulate the Command of the Message Mantra
   *  Articulate the 30 second GitLab elevator pitch (memorized)

For now, the same requirements apply for all customer-facing roles. As we transition all the coursework into EdCast, our new Learning Experience Platform (LXP), we may create more role-specific requirements for graduation. Upon completion of SQS, the final grade report will be provided to the managers for review.
