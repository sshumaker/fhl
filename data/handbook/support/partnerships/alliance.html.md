## Contacting Support

Alliance and Technology Partners may contact us by submitting a ticket from the
[support portal](https://support.gitlab.com). Each representative of an
Alliance Partner must arrange for their account on the
[support portal](https://support.gitlab.com) to be created for  them
**prior to submitting a ticket for the first time**. To make that
arrangement, they should contact their Customer Success Manager, Account
Executive or other member of their GitLab Sales team.

Once the account has been created, an Alliance Partner should submit tickets
using only 
[this specialized form](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001172559).
Tickets submitted using any other form will not route correctly, which will
likely result in delays.


**Note to Support**: Pay close attention to the organization notes an Alliance
Partner has on their account. These often provide critical information about how
to provide the very best support possible.

[GitLab provides no support for NFR software issued to Alliance Partners.](https://about.gitlab.com/partners/technology-partners/integrate/#-additional-resources--support)

## File uploads

When Alliance Partners need to send files to GitLab Support, we have 3
methods available to them:

* Standard ticket uploads (20MB max)
* [Support Uploader](https://about.gitlab.com/support/providing-large-files/#support-uploader)
* A specialized connection to an s3 bucket
  * For this method, Support will use an application that is already
    available to them for listing and downloading the files as needed.

## Escalations

In rare events when an issue requires escalation, GitLab Support provides 
Alliance Partners with a personalized escalation form. Upon submission
of the form, the system can notify an appropriate GitLab Support Manager.
