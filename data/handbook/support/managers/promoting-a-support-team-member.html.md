### Support Engineer Promotion Process for Support Managers - Quick Guide

The companywide People Group process should be followed [For Managers: Requesting a Promotion or Compensation Change](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#for-managers-requesting-a-promotion-or-compensation-change). The steps below are an addendum for notification and review for Support Engineering managers, taking into account the Customer Support Department's organisational structure, and is not meant as a replacement for any steps in the companywide people group process.

#### Planning

[At GitLab, we promote on a quarterly cadence](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#promotion-process--timeline). Once a quarter, review
your candidates' progress towards promotion, and work with your manager to ensure the future promotion is accounted for in the annual plan.

If you have any questions, please ask in the `#fy23_support_promotions` Slack channel.

#### Calibration

While the [calibration section of the handbook](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#calibration) suggests a quarterly cadence, in Support we review
promotion docs asynchronously as soon as they are ready for review.

* Complete the appropriate template document with the Support Engineer: 
    * [FY23Q3+ Promotion to Senior Support Engineer - Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10MMr55fOkf-wACw82A2GdJ7jWbi0i9gMehovtKgthZI/edit#)
    * FY23Q3+ Promotion to Staff Support Engineer -- link TBD, updates in [this Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/support/-/epics/188)
* Create a public Google Docs view link for everyone at Gitlab to allow sharing of the promotion document which will be used for promotion approval process.
* Discuss the promotion candidate with your manager.
* Make a copy of the promotion document and share it in the confidential doc used in the cross-regional sync with Support Managers (ensure Support Managers can Edit).
* Gather feedback on the promotion document on the private copy shared with the Support Managers.
* If necessary, update the public document based on feedback from Support Managers.
* Get the approval to proceed from your manager.

#### Submission
* [Submit a Promotion request in BambooHR](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#submit-a-promotion-request-in-bamboohr)

#### Announcement

* Once approval has been received from People team, notify the engineer.
* Send a message to the `#team-member-updates` Slack channel.
* Share the message from `#team-member-updates` into the `#support-team-chat` channel for Support Team visibility.
