## BrowserStack

We have access to an application called [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) which allows you to load different browser versions on Windows/Mac/Android/iOS to reproduce potential browser issues on these Operating Systems.

The credentials are in 1Password.

Once logged in, you should navigate to the [browser dashboard](https://live.browserstack.com/dashboard) and choose your desired Operating System / browser.
