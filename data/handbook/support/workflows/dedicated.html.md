### Overview

[GitLab Dedicated](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/), from a support perspective, works as a combination of SaaS and Self-Managed. Customers have full Admin access to the instance, but no access to the infrastructure, nor to the backend configurations. This workflow captures the differences, and details of providing support for GitLab Dedicated.

If you'd like to work on GitLab Dedicated tickets, consider [creating an issue using the template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/issues/new?issuable_template=GitLab%20Dedicated) in Support Training, and read the [overview](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/).


### Administrative access to a Dedicated instance

The GitLab Dedicated team does not have administrative access to the GitLab application on Dedicated instances. Any support requests that require a GitLab instance administrator to make a change in the admin panel, for example resetting 2FA, has to be performed by the appropriate team within the customer organization.

### Working with logs

Support can access tenant logs through [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/).

[OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) can be used similar to [Kibana](./kibana.html).

#### Identifying tenants

Credentials needed for examining logs are stored in the `GitLab Dedicated - Support` vault. Each customer is noted by a customer number in the vault, so you must refer to the `<tenant name>` to identify the proper credentials to use for a customer. This is used as part of the accessible URL, such as: `<tenant name>.gitlab-dedicated.com`.

#### Accessing logs

To access the logs for a specific tenant find the credentials stored in the `GitLab Dedicated - Support` Vault, and access the corresponding tenant URL listed there.
Once in the tenant's OpenSearch site:

1. Select "Global" tenant
1. Choose "Discover" at the sidebar under OpenSearch Dashboards
1. On the next screen, you should see logs. Make sure that index `gitlab-*` is selected.

#### Searching logs

Since GitLab Dedicated uses [Cloud Native Hybrid reference architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html#cloud-native-hybrid-reference-architecture-with-helm-charts-alternative), searching logs on OpenSearch is a bit different from [Kibana](./kibana.html).

- Terms can be freely typed in the search bar
- Fields can also be used as filters, similarly to [Kibana](./kibana.html).

##### Fields and Filters

General fields:

- `host:` The GitLab host of the log. It can be `<tenant name>-gitaly-*`  or  `<tenant name>-consul-2`, etc.
- `referrer:` holds the project path. `https://tenant.gitlab-dedicated.com/example-group/test123`
- `message:` is the message that would be seen in the logs of a self-managed instance.  `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [08/Jul/2020:13:24:43 +0000] "GET /assets/webpack/commons-pages.projects.show-pages.projects.tree.show.21909065.chunk.js HTTP/1.1" 200 9316 "https://tenant.gitlab-dedicated.com/example-group/test123" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/102.0.5005.63 Safari/537.36" 1343 0.001 [default-gitlab-webservice-default-8181] [] xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8181 9309 0.000 200 fe130eac78314cwf352g3762397572cb`
- `kubernetes.labels.app:` used to filter Kubernetes pods. `nginx-ingress`, `webservice`, etc.

Gitaly related fields:

- `grpc.request.glProjectPath:` The actual GitLab path project path.
- `grpc.request.repoPath:`  Project hash id path.

SAML related fields:

- `action:saml`
- `path: /users/auth/saml/callback`
- `controller: OmniauthCallbacksController`
- `location: https://tenant.gitlab-dedicated.com/`

### Configuration changes

GitLab Dedicated uses the [Cloud Native Hybrid reference architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html#cloud-native-hybrid-reference-architecture-with-helm-charts-alternative). Instance implementation and changes are done via the [instrumentor project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/instrumentor)

When any changes to the tenant instance are required, please contact the GitLab Dedicated infrastructure team on Slack, using channel [`#g_dedicated-team`](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C025LECQY0M)

### Filing issues

In cases where Customer Support needs to interact with GitLab Dedicated engineers to gather information or similarly debug a problem at tenant's request (when Grafana or OpenSearch does not suffice), raise an issue in the [GitLab Dedicated issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues) using a [Support Request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/new?issuable_template=support_request).

### Escalating an Emergency issue

Emergencies from GitLab Dedicated will come through the [Customer Emergencies On-call Rotation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/customer_emergencies_workflows.html) as with other emergency types.

The GitLab Dedicated Infrastructure team has a 24/7 PagerDuty rotation: [GitLab Dedicated Platform Escalation](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/schedules#PE57MNA). To [manually create a PD Incident](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/workflows/support_manager-on-call.html#manually-triggering-a-pagerduty-notification_) use the [Dedicated Platform Service](https://gitlab.pagerduty.com/service-directory/P1H70IW) or use the Slack command `/pd trigger` and choose "Dedicated Platform Service" as the Impacted Service to escalate an emergency to an SRE after initial triage and analysis.

### Troubleshooting tips

#### Tagging logs while running tests

Customers can add a custom identifier, such as the ticket ID, to the `user-agent` field when testing. This makes it easier to filter logs related to the test.

For example:

```bash
curl -k -vvv -A"GitLabSupport012345" "https://tenant.gitlab-dedicated.com/users/sign_in"
```
