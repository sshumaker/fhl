## Baobab workflows and processes

Suggestions for improvements to these workflows are encouraged at any time, from any team member! 

# When a new ticket preferred region is not your region

- Follow the global [Assigning a ticket with a different preferred region](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets.html#assigning-a-ticket-with-a-different-preferred-region) workflow.
- Until another SE has taken assignment, keep the ticket assigned to yourself and continue to work with the customer.
- The `Unsorted::Clarify preferred region assignment` [macro](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+5602977263388) can be used to inform a customer that their ticket has been assigned to an engineer outside of their preferred region, and to gather confirmation from the customer on how they'd like to proceed in this regard.

# How to handle HPAR tickets

- Reply if you can or leave an internal comment, especially if the ticket is near breaching, and 
  take assignment of it.
- Make sure to leave a word for the next region to keep an eye on the ticket (in a handover thread on slack), 
  or have other unofficial assignees in other regions. Identify those people and work with them towards resolution.

# How to handle NRTs

- If FRT queue is in a good shape, we can start picking up NRTs.
- Prioritize the tickets that have no assignee or whose assignees are OOO.
- If another SE has done significant work on a ticket (whether assigned or not) and are available, ping them to see
  if they can carry on with it, and offer to pair with them if they are stuck or overloaded.
- When you respond to a ticket assigned to someone on PTO assign it to yourself and CC the original assignee.
- Try to handle the near breaching NRTs first.
- Try to make sure we don't have any > 5 days NRT breaches.
- Reach out to the team for help with tricky ones.

# How to handle tickets before going to PTO

- Follow the global guide on [preparing for time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/support-time-off.html#preparing-for-time-off) and [coverage for assigned tickets](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/support-time-off.html).
- Notify the team the day before you start PTO that you are leaving, and thank them in advance for responding to 
any that need it while you are away. 
- All team members should make a note of this to assist with determining whether to respond immediately to an open 
ticket vs. checking with/waiting for the assignee.

# Pairings

**Reminder**: As all GitLab meetings are optional, scheduled sync/pairing sessions are optional as well.
We have a Baobab Zoom room that's used for sync/pairing purposes. The link is pinned in Slack.
You can indicate your presence in the room by creating a thread in the Baobab Slack channel or
by using the Slack huddle button. Remember to mute yourself in Slack!
Maple [has documented](../maple/#using-the-maple-zoom-room) their method of indicating presence
that we can use as a guide.

There is an APAC-friendly weekly sync conversation on Wednesdays at 0400 UTC where we discuss SGG experiences 
and issues ([agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAIdDPj1Ez58gTrTxz_oBcu1GHQ7yWiDTTiU6ebfz6s/edit#heading=h.plwzgccful3f)).

There are Ticket Crush sessions scheduled at the following times:
  - Wednesdays at 04:00 UTC
  - Thursdays at 04:00 UTC
  - Mondays at 11:00 UTC (EMEA)
  - Wednesdays at 11:00 UTC (EMEA)
  - Tuesdays at 14:30 UTC (EMEA/AMER)
  - Thursdays at 08:00 UTC (APAC/EMEA)

There is also a social chat on Fridays at 10:30 UTC.

# Focus Time

Focus time is important to work on training modules and side projects. To help commit to our focus time, without worrying about leaving the queue unattended, fill in the table with your scheduled focus time in UTC.

This way, we will ensure not more than one person is away from the queue at the same time.

In case you need to change or reschedule your focus time, please notify your regional team mates.
