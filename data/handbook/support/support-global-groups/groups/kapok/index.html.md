## Kapok workflows and processes

AMER has a standing weekly crush session - all are welcome to attend.
The Zoom link is pinned to the Slack channel and is [here also](https://gitlab.zoom.us/j/91565753538?pwd=cFkrTEFyZjNKQnRqODhCeG1pdFdNdz09).

### Slack

When questions are asked of Kapok - for example, when asking for assistance with a specific ticket - Kapok engineers will respond with an emoji to show whether we have availability for the specific ticket or not.

- Red Circle: This means the agent doesn't have capacity for the ask.
- Yellow Circle: This means they can help but have other tickets that need to be addressed first or can help but cannot take assignment.
- Green Circle: This means they are willing to take over the ticket.
- Questions about music will always be addressed.

#### Daily Slack thread

Every morning for each region the Support Team Bot posts an update to the Kapok channel that `@` mentions support engineers who are anticipated to be working, with colored dots that correspond to staffing levels for SaaS and SM. (red circle: low, yellow circle: medium, green circle: high)

The AMER Kapok group usually starts a thread from this post describing what our priorities are for the day, including mentioning possible time AFK and challenging tickets.

### Cross-region Ticket Handover

If a handover to a customer's preferred region is requested, either due to a troubleshooting call request outside of your timezone or if general communication is easier in the customer's preferred region, please try to follow this process:

- Please ensure troubleshooting calls are in-line with our [video and phone call policy](https://about.gitlab.com/support/#phone-and-video-call-support), and:
     - You've exhausted all async troubleshooting steps.
     - There's no availability within your timezone.
- Add an internal note on the ticket with the current status, what has been done so far for troubleshooting, and the next steps.
- Alert the folks on the daily standup bot thread *or* [schedule slack a message](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082-Schedule-messages-to-send-later) to be sent when folks in the requested region are online.
- Engineers in the region will add the availability emojis to communicate the availability.
- If no engineer has the bandwidth to handle the ticket, request help from the larger team in the proper channel (for dotcom tickets: `#support_gitlab-com`, and self-managed: `#support_self-managed`)

### PTO

When more than 2 agents in a given region are on PTO, relevant tickets and questions about coverage are usually discussed during our [weekly Kapok Crush](https://gitlab.zoom.us/j/91565753538?pwd=cFkrTEFyZjNKQnRqODhCeG1pdFdNdz09) (Wednesdays at 8:00 PM UTC) or ad-hoc via a [Slack](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C03C6JQV3EZ) thread.

If you have questions about coverage or whether you should take PTO or not, feel free to start a thread in the [Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C03C6JQV3EZ).

**Note**: Candid and honest communication about the impacts of PTO on the SGG team are completely OK as long as we're remembering [our values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) when communicating with each other! Also note that we take our time away from work seriously, never feel bad about your PTO! We all need it.

## Kapok Team Building

In July 2022, the folks in Kapok in the AMER region gathered to learn more about one another by delivering presentations in a loose interpretation of the [PechaKucha](https://www.pechakucha.com/) style. GitLab team members with access to [this folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1csUbGWeu9yBZ1TilTl-Gu3P1SZ2B9IB4?usp=sharing) can [watch and enjoy the video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aYfFsiYie9lRnC9fEdWDL7FdIALfkh8G/view?usp=sharing).
