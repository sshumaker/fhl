## Overview

Schedules in Zendesk are like schedules in most other things: windows of time.
We use these to determine business hours and various regional working hours.

## GitLab Schedules

## Holidays

All schedules should utilize the same holidays. The ones we currently put into
Zendesk are:

* Easter (this is a "movable feast" holiday, so it changes each year)
* Christmas (December 25th)
* New Years Day (January 1st)

On those day, the schedules "stop", which results in the SLA clock not moving.
This allows for Support to actually have those holidays "off".
