## Overview

To help reduce the time needed prepare for 1-1s, some managers opt to use the
[1-1-issue-generator project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/1-1-issue-generator).
This shortens the process of preparing for a 1-1 by gathering various details
and compiling them into an issue. This allows managers and reports to focus on
the content of the issue and what they wish to speak about instead of gathering
data manually.

For more details on how this works, please see the
[project's README](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/1-1-issue-generator/-/blob/master/README.md).
