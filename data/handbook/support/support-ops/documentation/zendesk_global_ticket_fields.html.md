## Overview

Ticket fields are the items within a ticket form that contains various metadata for the ticket.

## Ticket field management

Instead of managing Zendesk ticket fields via Zendesk itself, we instead use GitLab
itself via the
[ticket-forms-and-fields project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/ticket-forms-and-fields).
This allows us to have version-controlled ticket fields. For more information on
managing Zendesk via the various GitLab projects, please review
[Using the sync repos](sync_repos.html).

### Current active ticket fields

### Current triggers

As we have many fields, and they change quite frequently, the best resource to
see all the current fields would be the
[ticket-forms-and-fields project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/ticket-forms-and-fields).
