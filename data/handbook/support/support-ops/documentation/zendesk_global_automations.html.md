## Overview

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662236-About-automations-and-how-they-work):

> Automations are similar to triggers because both define conditions and actions
> that modify ticket properties and optionally send email notifications to
> customers and agents. Where they differ is that automations execute when a
time event occurs after a ticket property was set or updated, rather than
immediately after a ticket is created or updated.

The simpler way to think of it is automations are triggers that do not run
instantly. They are time based than event based.

## Automations management

Instead of managing Zendesk automations via Zendesk itself, we instead use
GitLab itself via the
[automations project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/automations).
This allows us to have version-controlled automations. For more information on
managing Zendesk via the various GitLab projects, please review
[Using the sync repos](sync_repos.html).
