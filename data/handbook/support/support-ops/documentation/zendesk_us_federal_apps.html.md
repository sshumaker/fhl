## Overview

Zendesk can have applications installed into it to enhance its capabilities.
Here at GitLab, we use quite a few apps to help make Zendesk even better!

Zendesk applications tend to come from one of two areas:

* [The Zendesk Marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/)
* Developed in-house

<!-- When time allows, make a page detailing _how_ to create an application -->

## App locations

Applications can be run in a great many places, but the traditional locations
are:

* [Ticket sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/support-api/ticket_sidebar)
* [User sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/support-api/user_sidebar)
* [Organization sidebar](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/support-api/organization_sidebar)
* [Navbar](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/support-api/nav_bar)
* [Background](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/support-api/background)

You can see more resources on application locations via the
[Zendesk Developer Manifest Reference](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/developer-guide/manifest#location)
documentation.
