## Overview

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690806-Creating-views-to-manage-ticket-workflow):

> Views are a way to organize your tickets by grouping them into lists based on
> certain criteria. For example, you can create a view for unsolved tickets
> that are assigned to you, a view for new tickets that need to be triaged, or a
> view for pending tickets that are awaiting response. Using views can help you
> determine what tickets need attention from you or your team and plan
> accordingly.

Currently, Zendesk has 3 view types:

* Default: Pre-defined views created by Zendesk
* Shared: Views created by the Zendesk Administrator(s) (ie. Support Ops)
* Personal: Views created by you and usable only by you

Currently, Zendesk views have some limitations:

* Only 12 visible views (Default and Shared) will be displayed.
* Views cannot use criteria that is not "defined", meaning it must be selectable
  data (text fields will not work, as an example).
* You can only display up to 8 personal views and Support Ops cannot manage/view them.
* Views will not include [archived tickets](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203657756-About-ticket-archiving)
i.e. Closed tickets after 120 days.

## View management

Instead of managing Shared Zendesk views via Zendesk itself, we instead use GitLab
itself via the
[zendesk-views project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/views).
This allows us to have version-controlled views. Personal views can be managed by Zendesk itself.
For more information on managing Zendesk via the various GitLab projects, please review
[Using the sync repos](sync_repos.html).

## Moving tickets between views

The criteria for most views is centered around the form the ticket is using. But
there are some scenarios where the tags on a ticket can cause it to show in
multiple areas. In these cases, it is best to reach out to Support Operations
for guidance.
