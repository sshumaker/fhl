## Overview

This is a compilation of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for Zendesk Global.

### Can customers of this instance use the Global instance?

Yes they can! Because of the limited hours Zendesk US Federal is available, we
enable all US Federal customers to utilize Zendesk Global, with the
understanding that Zendesk Global is not restricted to US citizens only.

### Can SLED customers use this instance?

At this time, only accounts with a territory starting with USPUB-FED can use
this instance. As such, SLED (**S**tate, **L**ocal, **ED**ucation) customers would not eligible to utilize this
instance and would instead need to use the Zendesk Global instance.
