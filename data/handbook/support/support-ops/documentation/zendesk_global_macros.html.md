## Overview

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001236988-Creating-macros-for-tickets):

> A macro is a prepared response or action that an agent can manually apply when
> they are creating or updating tickets. Macros contain actions that can update
> ticket properties.
>
> Unlike triggers and automations, macros only contain actions, not conditions.
> Conditions aren't used because nothing is automatically evaluating tickets to
> determine if a macro should be applied. Agents evaluate tickets and apply
> macros manually as needed.

Macros can do a wide range of these things, but the most common actions are:

* Make a public comment
* Add or remove ticket tags
* Change the ticket assignee
* Change the ticket form
* Populate ticket fields

## Macro management

Instead of managing Zendesk macros via Zendesk, we use GitLab
 via the
[macros project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/macros).
This allows us to have version-controlled macros. For more information on
managing Zendesk via the various GitLab projects, please review
[Using the sync repos](sync_repos.html).

### Current macros

As we have many macros, and they change quite frequently, the best resource to
see all the current macros is the
[macros project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/macros).

## How to link to macros

Because macro names sometimes change, linking to them directly is not recommended.
Instead, use the URL of a search for the macro's `id` number, like so:

> https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=2573624&project_id=17008590&scope=blob&snippets=false&search=id%3A+<id>
