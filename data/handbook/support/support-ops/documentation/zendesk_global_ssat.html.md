## Overview

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660816-Customizing-your-customer-satisfaction-survey)

> One of Zendesk Support’s most popular features is our built-in customer
> satisfaction survey. Customer satisfaction allows you to track how well your
> agents and customer service organization as a whole are performing on a
> ticket by ticket basis. Because of our simplified approach, on average our
> customers see a roughly 21% response rate - which is fantastic! Zendesk
> Support provides some great defaults for the survey, but we get a lot of
> questions about how to further customize the customer satisfaction
> experience. 

## Criteria for SSAT being sent out

Currently, Zendesk Global sends out surveys to all solved tickets, unless they
contain one of the following ticket tags:

* `spam_ticket` - means the ticket was marked as spam
* `free_customer` - means the ticket is from a non-paying user
* `com_embargo` - means the ticket pertains to US Sanctions/embargos
* `csat-survey-sent` - means the SSAT survey has already been sent out

This is done via the automation [`SSAT::Survey::Send out survey`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=20012489&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+46784293).

## End-user experience when the SSAT survey is sent

Once the
[`SSAT automation`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=20012489&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+46784293)
runs on the solved ticket, the user will receive the SSAT survey email where
they can rate their support experience directly from the email message. A sample
of this would look like:

![SSAT Survey Email](/images/support/ssat_survey_sample.png)

Once the user clicks either of the two satisfaction links in the email message,
the rating will be submitted and they'll be redirected to another page where
they can add a comment about the rating if they'd like.

![Good rated SSAT](/images/support/good_rated_ssat_sample.png)

In the event the user selects the `Bad, I'm unsatisfied` link, we ask them to
specify a reason for the dissatisfaction. 

The options available are:

* The issue was not resolved
* GitLab doesn't meet my needs
* The answer wasn't delivered in a timely manner
* The answer wasn't helpful

## Feedback to gitlab issues

As part of the SSAT review process, we have several triggers in place that
convert the responses into GitLab issues in the
[Customer Feedback project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/feedback).
The current triggers are:

* [`SSAT::Issue Creation::When reason is ‘No reason provided’`](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=2573624&project_id=20010334&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&nav_source=navbar&search=id%3A+360041667219)
