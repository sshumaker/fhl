## Overview

GitLab's subscription to Zendesk includes a Sandbox environment, which is
intended to be used as a testing ground (staging/dev area) for all major changes
to the support portal prior to deploying those changes to the production
instance of Zendesk.

## Gaining Access

With the Sandbox instance, we only have 50% of the seats our production Zendesk
instance has available. As such, not every person has a Sandbox account. To
request one, please utilize an
[access request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new)
to have one provisioned. Please make sure to include:

* Why you need access to it
* How long you need access to it
* If you need heightened permissions
* Why you need heightened permissions (if applicable)
* Which instance's Sandbox access is being requested (Global / U.S. Federal)

The provisioner for these requests will be the Support Operations Manager
(@jcolyer).

## Test Users and Organizations

To help both facilitate easy testing and keep the sandbox in a clean state,
Support Operations has created some test organizations and users you can use.
Whenever possible, please utilize these organizations and users to test "end
user" experiences.
Note: These users, roles and organizations currently only exist for the Global Support Portal Sandbox.
