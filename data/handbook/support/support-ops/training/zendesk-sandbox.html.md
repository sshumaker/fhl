## What this covers

This training material will cover the following topics:

* A broad overview of what a Zendesk Sandbox is
* How to access the Zendesk Sandbox
* Pre-defined users and orgs

## What is the Zendesk Sandbox

The Zendesk Sandbox is a replica Zendesk instance you can use to test, learn,
replicate, etc. in an environment that is separated from production instances.

We utilize the Zendesk Sandbox in all our change management processes. This
allows us a safe and secure place to test changes/updates/etc. so we can
ensure the implementations we push into production are both stable and well
vetted.

## How to access the Zendesk Sandbox

If you are a Support Operations team member, please reach out to your manager
to have this provisioned if it does not already exist. As part of our baseline
entitlements, this should be created during your onboarding.

For more details on gaining access to the Zendesk Global sandbox, please see
[Zendesk Global Sandbox - Gaining Access](../documentation/zendesk_global_sandbox.html#gaining-access).

For more details on gaining access to the Zendesk US Federal sandbox, please
see
[Zendesk US Federal Sandbox - Gaining Access](../documentation/zendesk_us_federal_sandbox.html#gaining-access).

Once you have a user, simply go to the Zendesk Sandbox URL and login with your
username (email) and password. After doing so, you should be redirected to the
agent pages for the instance.
