## What this covers

This training material will cover the following topics:

* A broad overview of what a Zendesk automation is.
* Creating/editing/deactivating Zendesk automations via the UI
* Understanding Zendesk automation positioning.
* GitLab Support Ops automation standards.
* GitLab Support Ops change management process for Zendesk automations.

## What are automations

As per
[Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662236-About-automations-and-how-they-work):

> Automations are similar to triggers because both define conditions and actions
> that modify ticket properties and optionally send email notifications to
> customers and agents. Where they differ is that automations execute when a
time event occurs after a ticket property was set or updated, rather than
immediately after a ticket is created or updated.

The simpler way to think of it is automations are triggers that do not run
instantly. They are time-based instead of being event-based.

## Creating an automation via Zendesk

**Note**: As of 2021-09-21, Zendesk has changed the location of the automations
management pages. They are now located in the Admin Center, which you can locate
by clicking the four squares in the top-right of the page and clicking the
Admin Center link. After doing so, you can locate the automations management
pages under `Objects and rules` > `Business rules` > `Automations`. All videos
are of the old location (i.e. in the admin panel). Once you access the
management pages, the steps to create/edit/etc. are the same.

</figure>

To create an automation in Zendesk, you first need to go to the admin center,
which can be located by the clicking the four squares in the top-right of the
page and clicking the Admin Center link. After doing so, you can locate the
automations management pages under `Objects and rules` > `Business rules` >
`Automations`.

After doing so, you will then click the `Add automation` button on the top-right
side of the page. This will then load up the new automation page.

From here, you will:

1. enter a title for the automation.
1. enter the conditions that **all** must be met to trigger this automation.
1. enter the conditions of which **any** of them can trigger this automation (in
   conjunction with the **all** conditions).
1. enter the actions for the automation to perform

After doing this, you will then click the blue `Create automation` button.

**Note**: By default, the automation's position will be set to the bottom of all
automations. To adjust this, see [Positioning](#positioning).

## Editing an automation via Zendesk

**Note**: As of 2021-09-21, Zendesk has changed the location of the automations
management pages. They are now located in the Admin Center, which you can locate
by clicking the four squares in the top-right of the page and clicking the
Admin Center link. After doing so, you can locate the automations management
pages under `Objects and rules` > `Business rules` > `Automations`. All videos
are of the old location (i.e. in the admin panel). Once you access the
management pages, the steps to create/edit/etc. are the same.

<figure class="video_container">

</figure>

Editing a Zendesk automation is very similar to
[creating one](#creating-an-automation-via-zendesk). You will follow the same
steps to get the automations page. Instead of clicking the `Add automation`
button, you will instead locate the automation to edit in the list and click on
the title (if your automation is currently inactive, you will need to click the
`Inactive` tab, located above the list of automations).

Doing so will bring up the automation editor page. From here, you can tweak the
various aspects of the automation. Once you have the edits in place, ensure the
dropdown at the bottom right says `Update` and click the blue `Submit` button.

## Deactivating an automation via Zendesk

**Note**: As of 2021-09-21, Zendesk has changed the location of the automations
management pages. They are now located in the Admin Center, which you can locate
by clicking the four squares in the top-right of the page and clicking the
Admin Center link. After doing so, you can locate the automations management
pages under `Objects and rules` > `Business rules` > `Automations`. All videos
are of the old location (i.e. in the admin panel). Once you access the
management pages, the steps to create/edit/etc. are the same.

<figure class="video_container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXqLTat0n9U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

There are actually two ways to deactivate an automation in the Zendesk UI. The
quicker way is to go to the automation page, locate the automation in question,
hover over it, and click the three vertical dots on the right-hand side. This
will bring up a sub-menu, which contains the option to `Deactivate`. Click that
option and the automation will be deactivated.

The alternative way to deactivate an automation in the Zendesk UI is from within
the automation editor page. At the bottom right, ensure the dropdown says
`Deactivate` and then click the blue `Submit` button.

**Note**: Deactivating an automation does not change its position. This value is
retained in the backend. Re-enabling the automation will have it take the same
position it was in while previously active.

## Positioning

**Note**: As of 2021-09-21, Zendesk has changed the location of the automations
management pages. They are now located in the Admin Center, which you can locate
by clicking the four squares in the top-right of the page and clicking the
Admin Center link. After doing so, you can locate the automations management
pages under `Objects and rules` > `Business rules` > `Automations`. All videos
are of the old location (i.e. in the admin panel). Once you access the
management pages, the steps to create/edit/etc. are the same.

<figure class="video_container">

</figure>

Many components of Zendesk using positioning to determine the overall run order.
With automations being time-based events, it is not often as important to worry
about positioning as with something like triggers or views. We should still
strive to be very deliberate in the positioning we use. A good thought to have
is "what order would I want these running in if they all ran at once?"

By default, new automations gain a position of `N+1`, where `N` is the highest
position value of all automations currently in Zendesk (both active and
inactive). This is desired and we should _rarely_ need to change this.

To edit positions in the Zendesk UI, go to the automations page. From there,
click the three horizontal dots at the top-right of the page (on the same line
as the search bar). That will bring up a sub-menu with the option
`Reorder page.` Clicking that will then allow you to drag and drop the list of
automations into the order you desire. After making the changes, click the blue
`Save` button at the top right of the page.

**Note**: Both active and inactive automations have a integer positional value.
While this does not matter in the UI, it will matter in the repo sync we
utilize.

## Automation standards

To ensure all automations we utilize are both consistent in nature and
transparent in their actions, we strive to meet some standards on all
automations we work with.

### Naming standards

As Zendesk automations do not support categorization at this time, we have
implemented a naming standard to help categorize the automations we have. This
standard is as follows:

`What it impacts::What it does/Who it impacts::Name of automation`

#### Example 1

If you were making an automation to send a notification to Jason once a ticket
has been in an open state for more than 24 hours, you would use the automation
name of:

`Notifications::Jason::Notify ticket has been open for more than 24 hours`

This is because:

* the `What it impacts` is "Notifications", since it sends a notification.
* the `What it does/Who it impacts` is "Jason", since it sends a
  notification to Jason.
* the `Name of automation` can be whatever the creator wants for this, but it
  should be relatively short and describe the automation in a way that anyone
  who knows our naming standards can look at it and know what it does.

#### Example 2

If you were making an automation that sets a ticket to `Closed` after it has
been in the state of Solved for 24 hours, you would use the automation name of:

`Status::Close::Autoclose after 24 hours solved`

This is because:

* the `What it impacts` is "Status", since it impacts a ticket's status.
* the `What it does/Who it impacts` is "Close", since it closes a ticket.
* the `Name of automation` can be whatever the creator wants for this, but it
  should be relatively short and describe the automation in a way that anyone
  who knows our naming standards can look at it and know what it does.

### Condition standards

Generally speaking, we aim to make automation conditions as simple as
possible. When possible, you should use condition sets that are very specific
and succinct. As an example, if you wanted an automation to only run when the
form is `Support Ops`, it is better to simply put a condition of "Form is
Support Ops" than adding exclusions for _every_ other form. This can take time
and practice to learn, so when in doubt, pair with the rest of the Support Ops
team!

## Change management

<figure class="video_container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSkyalDswso" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

When it comes to making changes to Zendeks automations, we utilize the
automations repos instead of doing this via the Zendesk UI. This allows
us to easily revert a change and ensure what is running in our production
instances is what we have approved. To ensure each runs smoothly, we do our
changes in set stages.

### Request stage

All Zendesk automation changes should start with a request issue. This issue
should stem from a
[support-team-meta](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/)
issue where the proposal was discussed.

The request should not be "make this change in Zendesk," unless the request is
coming directly from a Support Ops team member. If the request does not detail
_what_ the desired effect is, we as Support Ops should instead push back on the
request and ask the requester detail _what they want to see as a result_ and not
_what they want done in Zendesk_.

All request issues should contain the following labels at creation:

* "Support-Ops-Category::Automations"
* A priority label, which is one of:
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Urgent"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::High"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Normal"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Low"
* "Zendesk::Global" if this is about the Zendesk Global instance
* "Zendesk::US-Federal" if this is about the Zendesk US Federal instance
* "SupportOps::To Do"

While we have scripting and templating in place to find when these are missing,
you should strive to ensure those are present. If you find any of them missing,
please add them.

Once the request is in good standing, you may assign it to yourself (if it is
not already) and add the tag "SupportOps::Doing" to indicate you have started
working on this.

### Testing stage

When making a change to Zendesk automations (whether it be creation, editing, or
deactivation), we start the process in the Zendesk sandbox. In the Zendesk
sandbox for the corresponding Zendesk instance this impacts, you will make the
desired changes. Once this is done, update the original request issue with the
following:

* A link to the automation in the Zendesk sandbox
* However much time it took you to implement the changes in the sandbox
  * This can be down using the `/spend X minutes`, where `X` is the number of
    minutes you spent.
* What testing needs to be done.

You will then test these changes. This process should take no less than 3 days
after making the changes. This is to ensure that not only is the change tested
thoroughly, but others have time to review your tests and the results.

As automations often involve time-based events, you might want to lessen the
time event so you can test in a quicker fashion.

Often, you will need assistance testing out changes. Should this be required,
consider reaching out to the following for assistance in testing the changes:

* The original requester
* A fellow Support Ops team member
* A Support Ops Manager

If testing provides failed results, this means we need to update the original
request issue with what happened and why. If this is because of a flaw in the
request, we should state as much and recommend the requester go back to the
original
[support-team-meta](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/)
issue to re-discuss. If it failed due to our implementation, we should detail
what was wrong with the implementation and propose a new method to try.

Once the changes have been thoroughly tested (and are successful), make sure to
add the time you spent doing the testing to the original request.

At that juncture, update the issue with a comment to state testing has completed
and was successful. You should give the requester an opportunity to review the
test(s) and result(s). Ask if they would like to review them. If they decline,
you may move on. If they wish to do so, await their update after they have
reviewed the results.

### Repo stage

To prepare for the implementation, you will need to create a merge request to
the corresponding automations repo (see [Useful links](#useful-links)
down below).

For an existing automation, this is a simpler approach, since the automation
already has an ID in Zendesk. Make the edits to the file in the repo and submit
the merge request in _draft mode_.

For _new_ automations, this gets a bit trickier, as there is not an ID in
Zendesk as of yet. To help with this, clone an existing automation and then
deactivate the cloned copy. You can then use this new automation's ID value in
the merge request.

After creating the merge request, make sure it is linked in the original
request and you have added any additional time spent to the requester issue.

From here, have one of your fellow Support Ops team members or a Support Ops
Manager review the merge request and add their approval (or comments). Once
approval has been added, an implementation date can be determined.

**Note**: All merge requests in the automations repo should contain the
following labels (the same as with issues):

* "Support-Ops-Category::Automations"
* A priority label, which is one of:
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Urgent"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::High"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Normal"
  * "Support-Ops-Priority::Low"
* "Zendesk::Global" if this is about the Zendesk Global instance
* "Zendesk::US-Federal" if this is about the Zendesk US Federal instance
* "SupportOps::To Do"

### Pre-implementation announcement stage

Once an implementation date has been determined, you need to announce this
upcoming change. To do this, go to the Slack channel
`#support_ops-accouncements` and click the lightning bolt on the text box (this
is the shortcuts icon). From there, select `Support Ops Announcement`. This
will cause a form to pop-up. Fill out the form to generate a message in the
`#support_ops-accouncements` channel.

The form asks for the following:

* **Who** is this impacting
* **What** is changing
* **When** is it changing
* **Why** is it changing
* Other info (optional)
* **Request link**

Once it posts, you will need to screenshot the post message and add that to the
`Support Operations Corner` of the
[Support Week in Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyMzbzImSKNFMpmu33C6imvC1iWEWHREJqaD6mkVDNg/edit?usp=sharing)
document

After adding it in the Support Week in Review, you then want to cross-link
(copy the link to the post) the announcement to the following channels:

| Channel | When to cross-link |
|---------|--------------------|
| `#support_operations` | Every time |
| `#support_team-chat` | If this impacts Support only or Everyone |
| `#spt_managers` | If this impacts Support only or Everyone |
| `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` | If the change is concerning SLA OR provisioning/deprovisioning |

### Implementation stage

This stage should be the simplest one to implement, as you already have a merge
request ready to go! Simply mark the merge request as ready and merge it. If
you encounter any issues here, reach out to your fellow Support Ops team members
for assistance.

### Post-implementation announcement stage

Once an implementation has been completed, you need to announce the change. To
do this, go to the Slack channel `#support_ops-accouncements` and click the
lightning bolt on the text box (this is the shortcuts icon). From there, select
`Support Ops Announcement`. This will cause a form to pop-up. Fill out the form
to generate a message in the `#support_ops-accouncements` channel.

The form asks for the following:

* **Who** is this impacting
* **What** is changing
* **When** is it changing
* **Why** is it changing
* Other info (optional)
* **Request link**

Once it posts, you will need to screenshot the post message and add that to the
`Support Operations Corner` of the
[Support Week in Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eyMzbzImSKNFMpmu33C6imvC1iWEWHREJqaD6mkVDNg/edit?usp=sharing)
document

After adding it in the Support Week in Review, you then want to cross-link
(copy the link to the post) the announcement to the following channels:

| Channel | When to cross-link |
|---------|--------------------|
| `#support_operations` | Every time |
| `#support_team-chat` | If this impacts Support only or Everyone |
| `#spt_managers` | If this impacts Support only or Everyone |
| `#whats-happening-at-gitlab` | If the change is concerning SLA OR provisioning/deprovisioning |
