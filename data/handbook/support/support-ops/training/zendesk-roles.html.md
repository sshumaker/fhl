To create a Zendesk role, you will first need to go to the Admin Center by
clicking on the four squares at the top-right of the page and then clicking
`Admin Center`. From there, locate the `Roles` link, which is located at
`People` > `Team` > `Roles`.

From there, click the blue `Create role` button at the top right of the page.

On this page, you will first enter the name of the role (be short and specific)
and a short description of the role. From there, you will go through all the
various permissions and decide which the role can and cannot have.

Once you are done, click the blue `Create role` button at the bottom-right of
the page.
