### Contacts

This section contains a list of approved contacts for the Account. These users
are auto-associated in Zendesk.

### Subscriptions

Here, all subscriptions the account has had are listed. This is important as we
often need to review these to determine if an account's support level is
incorrectly set or not. The most important parts to look at are the start and
end dates.

### Subscription Product & Charges

This section contains the products tied to subscriptions. Here we can determine
if the support level is accurate or not based on the subscription name and the
effective end date.
