currently only use the ticket system.

### Ticket contents section

This section, which makes up the middle of the ticket page, is the main part of
the ticket page. It contains all the comments on a ticket (both internal and

### Footer section

This section makes up the very bottom of the ticket page. Here, agents can
apply macros to the ticket and submit updates.

The play settings are also present here (next to the `Submit as` button). These
determine what Zendesk does after updates are submiited. The options are:

* Close tab - this indicates Zendesk should close the entire ticket page after
  the updates are submitted

  the view that was used to open the ticket

  are submitted
