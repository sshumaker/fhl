## What this covers

This training material will cover the following topics:

* How to search in Salesforce
* Understanding search results

## How to search in Salesforce

Go to the any Salesforce page (the main page works, but all pages contain the
search form) and click in the textbox in the top-left of the page. In this box,
type your search term (see
[recommended search methods](#recommended-search-methods) to help here). After
you have entered your search term, hit the enter/return key on your keyboard to
perform the search.

## Recommended search methods

There is an art to performing a solid search which takes time and practice to
get the hang of. That said, there are some general recommendations that can
help you ensure you get the results you are aiming for:

* When search for an organization, try to use the more unique and specific
  parts of the organization name. Many contain words like `Inc`, `GmbH`, etc.
  Try to omit those and other common word pairs that might muddle your results.
* When searching for a contact, try using the email address or domain of the
  email address. This often will remove common results that are found based on
  common names.

## Understanding search results

A standard search in Salesforce will search through the following objects:

* Accounts
* Contacts
* Leads
* Opportunities

While there are many other objects you could expand the search to, this is
often not needed and can complicate (and lengthen) the search process. Once you
perform the search, locate the section that corresponds what you were looking
for.

If you are searching for an Account (i.e. Organization), the top section of the
search results is your go-to. In the results, you can see the names of the
found results, as well as the `Type` of Account. Knowing what type of account
you are looking for (i.e prospect vs customer vs partners) will help you in
locating the correct Account to click on for further review.

If you are searching for a Contact (i.e. User), the second section of the
search results is your go-to. In the results, you can see name, email, and
account name. You can use these to help locate the contact you wish to find and
be sure it corresponds to the organization the contact should be a part of.
