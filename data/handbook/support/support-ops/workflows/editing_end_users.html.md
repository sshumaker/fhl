## Overview

From time to time, you might need to edit end-users. This traditionally will
fall into one of 2 categories:

* [Merging end-users](#merging-end-users)
* [Increasing end-user permissions](#increasing-end-user-permissions)

## Merging end-users

From time to time, end-users will open multiple accounts for their various
email addresses. This can lead to a lot of confusion, so it is often best to
merge them into one another. To do this, open all the user pages in question.
Then locat the User ID of the primary one (it can be found in the URL). Using
this, go to the various user account pages and click the arrow next to the "New
Ticket" button. In the dropdown, select "Merge into another user". A modal will
then appear, asking for the User ID to merge the user into. Input the User ID
of the primary account, then click the "Merge" button. It will then show you
what it will do. Once you are sure this is correct, click the "Confirm and
merge" button.

## Increasing end-user permissions

This traditonally will stem from a Shared Organization request. The process for
doing this is exactly the same as a Shared Organization request, except you
make the changes on the User page. See
[Shared Organizations](shared_organizations.html) for more details.
