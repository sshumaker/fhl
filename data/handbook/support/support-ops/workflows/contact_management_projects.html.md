## Overview

This covers working tickets involving contact management projects. Please see
[the training page](../training/contact_management_projects.html) for more
information on the setup and management of the projects themselves.

## Requests for setup

When you receive these, you would use the details within
[the training page](../training/contact_management_projects.html) to setup the
contact management project. After doing so, you would then use the macro
`Support::Support Ops::Contact management project setup` to give the customer
confirmation of the setup and basic instructions on its use.

## Issues for existing setup

These can vary, so you will need to review what issues they are encountering,
check the contact management project for issues, and check the ops.gitlab.net
project's CI/CD pipelines for issues.

## Requests for removal of a contact management project

If a customer wants to no longer use a contact management project, follow the
instructions on
[the training page](../training/contact_management_projects.html) to remove the
association to their organization.
