## Overview



## Process

1. The GitLab team member files an access request (AR) using the
   [GitLab Team Member License request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=GitLab_Team_Member_License_request).
1. GitLab team member pings Support Ops.
1. Support Operations reviews the AR to ensure it meets the acceptable
   parameters.
   1. If it does not, review the reason it goes outside the acceptable
      parameters. If this is valid, proceed. If not, communicate via the issue
      that the reason is not sufficient.
1. Support Operations logs into the
   [CustomersDot app](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/new) and
   generates the license using the parameters in the AR.
1. Support Operations updates the AR and closes it out.
