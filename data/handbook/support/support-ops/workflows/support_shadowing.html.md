## Overview

Every month every Support Ops Specialist shadows Support Engineers as they work
through tickets. We do this so we can be proactive in finding potential
problems and work to resolve them. During these sessions, ask questions to
better understand how Support is using Zendesk. Based on what is learned,
Support-ops issues are created to better improve the system for those using it.


## Scheduling

To schedule a shadowing session, reach out to the Support Managers for the
region you are reviewing (we as a team should ensure we shadow ALL regions at
least 3 times). They should be able to assist you in finding a Support Engineer
with whom to pair for a 60-minute session.

As a general recommendation, try to aim your scheduling around Support Engineer
focuses and hit each of the biggest ones:

* SaaS (GitLab.com) focused
* Self-Managed focused
* License and Renewals (L&R) focused

## Issue creation

Once you have scheduled the meeting, you should create an issue using the
[Support Shadowing template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/support-shadowing/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Support%20Shadowing)
in the Support Shadowing project.

After the shadowing, try to use what was discussed and witnessed in the session
to determine potential improvements Support Ops can make for Support. If you do
make an issue from this, please mention the shadowing issue in the improvement
issue.

## Actioning

From the issues created, Support-ops should review these and determine what can
be actioned on. The main objective of all this is to improve Zendesk for all
who are using it. This is why it is **vital** we review and take action on
these whenever possible.
