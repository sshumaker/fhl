This page outlines workflows relevant to folks using the `L&R` form in Zendesk. 

## Working on tickets

### Assignment and hot queue model

We accept that tickets in the L&R queue may require a different approach than tickets in other queues. Acknowledging and drawing inspiration from the [existing Working on Tickets workflow](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets.html), we have opted to adopt a "hybrid model". The hybrid model has an emphasis on assignment of tickets, while also allowing a "hot queue" (i.e taking the next-to-breach ticket from the top of the queue) methodology.

### The workflow

1. Start at the top of your own view and work on next-to-breach tickets that are assigned to you
1. Check the main view for New tickets in your region or all regions of preferred support
1. If you are able to make a public reply on the ticket, do so, assign the ticket to yourself, and complete the form data
1. If there is a New ticket that will breach in your timezone, but it is not in your region or all regions of preferred support, make a public reply if you can and leave the ticket unassigned
1. If there are Open tickets that are unassigned, with all regions or your region of preferred support, assign to yourself, complete the form data, and make a public reply if you can
1. If you are not able to make a public reply, please ask for assistance from your colleagues to drive the ticket forward
1. If there is an Open ticket that is assigned to someone outside of your timezone and the ticket will breach before the start of their working hours, make a public reply if you can and let them know if you have done so via Slack

## Zendesk form data overview

On the left sidebar in Zendesk in the ticket view, every form has data fields unique to that form. These data fields tell us more about the ticket, from the tags to the ticket type, the ARR and the information the customer filled out when submitting the ticket.

In L&R, the tickets that come into our queue are of interest to teams outside of Support. Therefore, it's important that we gather accurate data about the tickets that we interact with. The form data completed on each ticket is taken into account for existing metrics dashboards and for any future data queries we may want to make. For examples of metrics dashboards that rely on L&R ticket data see the [L&R Dashbaord](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/explore/dashboard/CE496B0DE0C45903F2C8FFEE0ABA251DE82217E689B59F3FC62A23D3E7C592AD) and the [Support Metrics Dashboard](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/explore/dashboard/36925DBD1F5E3C7BA541DB38D11AC51E0EAAFDD30DCB63FDE83CF1389E555D96/tab/10638812).

## Zendesk form data guideline

Completing ticket data can be a very subjective process - the ticket might arguably be about two different things and it's up to the engineer to decide how to best categorise the ticket. It's more important to complete the data than to be objectively correct about what type of ticket it is.  

Two ways of thinking about ticket data selection:

1. What is the reason this ticket exists? i.e why did the customer create this ticket? Example reasons could be: system bug, needs assistance to complete provisioning, has inquiry about payment.
1. What would have prevented the ticket from existing? For example, if they knew how to reset their password or manage their account (ticket type: account management), or if they knew who their Sales rep was and was able to contact the rep (ticket type: Sales assistance required), the customer wouldn't have needed to submit a ticket.

Please also see the table below as a guideline on what `Transaction issue type` can be selected for scenarios:

### The `GitLab Issues` field

The `GitLab Issues` text field is available on all L&R tickets and should be completed whenever applicable. The purpose of this field is to capture links to existing issues. This field is specifically relevant to Fulfillment PMs who will be able to see an overview of any repeating or high volume issues, which they can then prioritise in upcoming milestones. Examples of when to use the field: 

1. There is a feature issue that, if implemented, would have prevented this ticket from being created.
1. There is a bug issue that can be replicated on the ticket.

This is a great way to log and get metrics for bugs and features that might need more attention from the product team as we can see numbers climb for an issue in real time. **Please complete this field with a link to an issue whenever possible.**
