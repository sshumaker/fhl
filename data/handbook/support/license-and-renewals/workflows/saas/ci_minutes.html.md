# Adding additional CI minutes

From time to time, you may need to grant additional CI minutes to a namespace
_without_ affecting the namespace's usual monthly quota.

## Process for authorising additional CI minutes to be added to GitLab Trial customers

- If a customer is in trial and a request is submitted to increase their amount of CI minutes to match those a Premium or Ultimate subscriber receives then the support engineer should seek authorisation from the customers sales representative to provide the additional CI Minutes, as they are able to self-authorise such requests. However, if a request is made for an increase in excess of the standard allotments of CI minutes (i.e. more than 10,000 minutes for a Premium trial and more than 50,000 minutes for an Ultimate trial) then a transaction is required and those minutes should be paid.

- For an existing customer - other than an act of goodwill (i.e product bug, unplanned GitLab.com downtime, performance issues etc...), any additional CI Minutes or Storage should be paid for


## Purchased CI minutes are not associated with customer's group

To transfer CI minutes from a user's personal namespace to a group namespace, use the [Force Association Mechanizer](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/toolbox/forms_processor/LR/force_associate.html).

**If the Mechanizer does not work**, you will need to request a refund for the customer.  In this case:
- Confirm that the CI minutes *are* associated with the user's personal namespace.
- Verify that the CI minutes associated with the personal namespace have not been consumed. You can check this under Usage Quotas in the users personal profile.  Note: If CI minutes are assigned to a personal namespace with no project or pipeline, this page will show `0/Not supported minutes has been consumed.`
    - **If they have not been consumed**, inform the customer that they've selected their personal namespace instead of their group when they purchased the CI minutes and pass the ticket to the [billing team](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/billing_contact_change_payments.html#refunds) to process the refund. The customer can then repurchase the CI minutes for their group.
    - **If they have been consumed**, the customer is not eligible for a refund - inform the customer that they are already using the purchased CI minutes, and redirect the customer to purchase a new CI minutes pack corresponding to their group.

## GitLab.com group is not visible during the purchase

- While purchasing the CI minutes, the billing page shows a drop-down menu to choose the namespace to be associated with the CI minutes. If the user is unable to view or choose the required group during the purchase, it is probable that the GitLab user is not an owner of that group.  Reply to the user stating that they need to either get their permissions updated to owner to be able to choose the group on the billing page, or request an existing owner of the group to purchase the CI minutes using their own customer portal account.

# Enable CI minutes

## Manual credit card validation for community contributors

Please do **not** use the enabling CI minutes process for validating a user account to bypass the need for a credit card when requested for community contributors. Instead, use the following method:

Requirements:

1. Requester has [filed an internal request](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/internal-requests-form/) or ZenDesk ticket to track request.
1. Request is approved or created by a [Community Relations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/#-meet-the-team) or [Contributor Success](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/contributor-success/#team-members) team member.
1. GitLab.com admin account

Steps:

1. Edit the user account `https://gitlab.com/admin/users/USERNAME/edit`.
1. Select the `Validate user account` checkbox.
1. Add an [Admin note](../../../workflows/admin_note.html).
1. `Save changes`.

## Enabling CI minutes for sales assisted trials

The following process will remove the restrictions for using CI minutes for groups who are part of a sales assisted trial.

## Steps

### Using Mechanizer

> <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle color-orange"></i> **NOTE**: Soon to be [deprecated](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/customersdot/mechanizer.html#mechanizer-notice)

Use the form named [enable Ci Minutes](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/toolbox/forms_processor/LR/enable_ci_minutes.html).
Enter the namespace information.

### Using customerDot Console

From the customerDot Console run the following function:

#### For sales assisted Trials

```ruby
irb(main) enable_ci_minutes_trial('namespace')

=> "{\"status\":\"success\",\"message\":\"namespace members are now enabled to run CI minutes\"}"
```
