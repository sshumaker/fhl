## Overview

Our [Code Contributor Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/#contributing-to-the-gitlab-enterprise-edition-ee) allows community contributors to contribute to GitLab Enterprise Edition. After trialling for 30 days, a EE license for 3 months can be generated if requested by a Community Relations team member using [the request form](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/internal-requests-form/). Subsequent requests can be processed every 3 months.

## Actioning
An internal request will be received [similar to this example](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/293087), which should contain the required information to generate a 90-day license. Follow the [procedure to create a new license](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/creating_licenses.html#create-a-new-license), ensuring the following:

- Plan: `Ultimate`, unless specified otherwise.
- Trial: `Yes` (is ticked)
- Starts at: (The current date)
- Expires at: (90 days from the current date)

## Responding

Once you've generated the license, send a public response on the internal request including the requestor, who will be CC'd, confirming that the license has been generated and sent directly to the contact on the email address provided.
