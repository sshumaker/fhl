## Scenario

Customer was opted into cloud licensing because of a [bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/systems/-/issues/1915) and their instance activated cloud licensing, an entity change happened and the new subscription was not on cloud licensing

### Troubleshooting workflow

1. Determine whether the customer should be on cloud licensing
1. **If no**, proceed with:
    1. Removing the current cloud license by asking the customer to run these commands via [rails console](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/rails_console.html): `l = License.find 123` and then `l.destroy`. You need to provide the license number for the first command. You can find this number in the URL of the cloud license in the customersdot license menu (example: https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/license/123123123)
    1. Once the license has been removed, the customer should have the ability to upload a standard license file on their instance.

## How to switch a subscription to cloud license features

1. Go to the customer's `Zuora Subscriptions` tab in customersdot (URL example: https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/customer/123123/zuora_subscriptions)
1. Tick the relevant feature boxes. DO NOT tick the `Cloud Licensing` checkbox. Click the `Update` button.
1. Click on the cloud icon next to the update button to generate an activation code for the subscription and email it to the customer.
1. Check that a code has been generated by viewing the `Cloud Activations` tab. Ensure that the code was generated for the correct subscription. 
1. Impersonate the customer's portal account to ensure that the activation code is available for the subscription.
1. Once the customer has used the activation code on their instance, a cloud license should have been generated (check the licenses section) and the `Cloud Licensing` checkbox from step 2 should now be checked.

## General Tips

1. You can resend an activation code via email by clicking on the envelope button on the customer's `Cloud Activations` tab.
