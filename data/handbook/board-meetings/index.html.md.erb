#### Board Materials
GitLab uses Nasdaq’s Boardvantage (NBV) portal for the electronic dissemination and storage of materials relating to GitLab’s Board Meetings. 

For a more detailed overview of navigating the NBV portal, please click here to view the [Internal Reference Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O10S3JXA5W_Zj1WlvMWyb3welm4jLAHxrurY493U0IU/edit#heading=h.cyhfykp20l6r).

### Agenda

1. Prior to distributing the Board deck, the CFO or EBA to the CFO groups questions together in the BOD Meeting Agenda by function or topic. Notes *should not* be taken by any GitLab team members in the agenda document during the meeting as requested by Legal.
1. Key Board material is presented during Board Meeting sessions. This includes:
   * The General Session Board deck (excluding the appendix or any pre-read slides, memos or videos)
   * The Administration Session for Board Committee readouts by the Committee Chairperson updating the Board as to the Committee’s activities and highlighting the items requiring Board approval, if any. 
1. Questions can be asked throughout the meeting. 30 minutes are reserved at the end of the General Session for Q&A / Discussion. 
1. At the conclusion of the General Session the E-Group, Observers, CoS to the CEO, Staff EBA, CEO Shadows depart the zoom meeting and the full Board shall meet for a Closed Session.

### Board Deck

1. The deck should start with a CEO Overview section which includes: list of up to ten [GitLab KPIs](/company/kpis/#gitlab-kpis). These should reflect the team’s prioritizations. The expectation is that these metrics will be on the list for a year or longer. The CEO Overview will also include slides on: prior quarter or fiscal year overview, trends, challenges, opportunities and current fiscal year priorities.  
1. The deck highlights 2 key asks for Board input during the meeting. Each ask should have a few key slides that provide historical context, current status, and plans for the future. We strive to have 2 key asks and at least 20 minutes spent on these topics. The key asks are typically presented during the meeting and may include team members from across the organization to join the meeting. 
1. The deck includes a Sales and Marketing section composed of: an executive summary slide on OKRs and key learnings, prior quarter review, upcoming quarter and fiscal year outlook. It may also include a competitive landscape update and any other relevant key updates. 
1. The deck includes an R&D section composed of: an executive summary slide on OKRs and key learnings, R&D investments, product themes, efficiency drivers, revenue drivers, and any other key updates. 
1. The deck includes a People Group section composed of: Attrition and General Update. 
1. The deck should strive to not exceed 7 slides per group.
1. Slides should convey a high-level overview as opposed to operational updates and will not include embedded links.
1. Put information on public webpages such as [/strategy](/company/strategy/) as much as possible.
1. Sensitive information goes into the Administration deck managed by the CFO.
1. Font size should be minimum 16pt, footnotes excluded. We want to make sure everything can be read.
1. Every slide should have a title which provides the key takeaway from that slide. 

#### Sales Slides

The Sales Slides should always include:

1. An overview of segment and geographic success
1. A sales overview including revenue, % of plan, growth versus last year and other key metrics

#### Finance Presentation

The Finance slides are as follows:

1. Review past quarter and YTD: Bookings review (growth rates) / new/growth and by sales zone
1. Review past quarter and YTD: P&L vs plan with commentary
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Revenue deep dive
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Gross Margin deep dive
1. Review past quarter and YTD: Cash waterfall
1. Forward looking: Rolling forecast that we will hold company accountable to in next quarter with commentary
1. Forward looking: Cash projection through end of year
1. Forward looking: LR plan adjustments with commentary
1. Forward looking: Balance sheet projection to match the 4Q Forecast 

### CEO Memo

The CEO is responsible for submitting a memo to the BoD in advance of the Board meeting. The memo captures GitLab highlights from the previous quarter, CEO OKRs for the coming quarter, and other topics that are top of mind for the CEO. The CoS to the CEO supports the CEO by creating an initial draft and sharing it with the CEO a week before the final draft is shared with E-Group. The memo should have online tests for readability before they are finalized or shared with the CEO. A tool, such as https://readable.com/, can be used. 

### Board Dinner

We usually have a Board Dinner on the evening before a Board Meeting. The EBA to the CEO is responsible for coordinating this dinner. Board Members, Local E-Group members, and the CoS to the CEO are all optional attendees. 

Each quarter, [E-Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#e-group) can choose to invite an additional team member as a Key Talent Guest. If this is desired in a specific quarter, at least a month before the dinner, the CoS to the CEO will gather nominations and ensure that E-Group has identified an invitee. Criteria for consideration includes:

1. [Key Talent](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent) 
1. High performance 
1. Clear results
1. Function (should have representation across functions throughout the year)
1. Diversity (participation from members in [GitLab Team Member Resource Groups](/company/culture/inclusion/erg-guide/) 

Once the Key Talent Guest has been identified, it is the relevant E-Group team member's responsibility to ensure that managers of this person are aware of the invite. The EBA to the CEO will then confirm that the guest is able to join. If not, the invite will go to the runner up. Once a Key Talent Guest is confirmed, the EBA to the CEO should enter their name in the [Key Talent guest list](/handbook/board-meetings/high-potential-board-dinner-guests). 

GitLab will cover this person's travel expenses. A person's location will not be considered in the selection criteria though the person's travel must be allowed under GitLab's [travel policies and guidelines](/handbook/travel/#policy-and-guidelines). 

As part of joining the dinner, the Key Talent Guest should come prepared to discuss:

1. Their background (both at GitLab and before joining)
1. What they have accomplished thus far at GitLab
1. What their plans are both now and in the future and what they see as a future for themselves at GitLab

Though no formal presentation is required, the Key Talent Guest should advise on how they want to discuss these topics with the Board and E-Group and coordinate with the EBA to the CEO. The CEO to the EBA will ensure that the Key Talent Guest has dedicated time at the dinner.

#### Key Talent Board Dinner Guests

Past and future Key Talent Dinner Guests are listed below.

| Date | Key Talent Guest |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2021-09-29 | [David DeSanto](https://gitlab.com/david) |
| 2021-12-13 | [Sherrod Patching](https://gitlab.com/users/spatching) |
| 2022-03-21 | [Christine Lee](https://gitlab.com/christinelee) | 
| 2022-12-12 | [Sherida McMullan](https://gitlab.com/sheridam) | 

## Board Recaps

Board Members often engage with team members on individual topics. Examples include conversations around security, development priorities, or sales pipeline. When this happens, and a subset of Board Members are involved, the E-Group leader responsible for a specific topic should provide a brief, email recap to all Board Members. When the information can be shared with all of E-Group, the individual email addresses of E-Group members should be CCed. When the information cannot be shared with all of E-Group, folks who should have context within E-Group should be CCed. This helps to ensure that all Board Members and relevant E-Group members are kept in the loop.

The Board Recap should include the following:

1. The objective of the meeting
1. Attendees, including titles
1. Key takeaway. This should include any big decisions made in the conversation or changes that result from it
1. A brief summary of what was discussed 

We don't include links to the handbook or full meeting notes as Board Recaps are designed to give the Board Members a quick overview. Emails can be sent from E-Group Members to board@gitlab.com. **Note:** a limited group of GitLab team members, including E-Group team members, have the permissions required for reaching the Board through this email alias. The Board cannot email e-group@gitlab.com directly, so individual team member email addresses should be added on Board correspondence. 

## Board Deep Dives

Board Members may request additional time for a deep dive on a specific topic. This ask often occurs during a Board Meeting. In these instances, the E-Group owner most responsible for the topic is the DRI for preparing for and scheduling the follow up conversation. The Board Members who asked for the meeting should be in attendance. All Board Members should be added to the invite as optional. These meetings should usually be scheduled for 50 minutes. When appropriate, these meetings should be recorded and posted to the NBV portal. The loop should always be closed with a [Board Recap](/handbook/board-meetings/#board-recaps) to the entire Board. 


## Quarterly AMA with the Board

We will have one Board member per quarter conduct an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session with the GitLab team. AMA’s are 25 minutes and live streamed to GitLab Unfiltered on YouTube. These AMA's are scheduled by the Staff EBA to the CEO.

- [David Hornik's AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwZNbF6_PX0%C2%A0)

## Board Selection Process

### Roles and Responsibilities

- [Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee](/handbook/board-meetings/#nominating-and-corporate-governance-committee) - Collaborate on Board evolution. Provide recommendations for potential new GitLab BoD members; meet and vet potential new board members; provide feedback on candidates.
- CEO and Selected Members of [E-Group](/company/team/structure/#e-group) - Meet and vet potential new board members; provide feedback on candidates.
- [CLO](/job-families/legal-and-corporate-affairs/chief-legal-officer/) - Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee DRI.
- [CEO's Staff Executive Business Administrator](/job-families/people-group/executive-business-administrator/) - DRI for Board and Committee scheduling.
- [Executive Recruiter](/job-families/people-group/executive-recruiter/) - Responsible for drafting communication to potential Board members as well as drafting email communication with Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee when questions arise.

### Interview Process

#### Independent

1. First meeting with the nominating board member;  50-minute meeting.
1. CEO and Board members: 50-minute meetings.
1. GitLab CRO, CFO, CLO and other E-Group members as requested.
1. Any parties as requested by the candidate.

## Board Renewal Process

Assuming GitLab adopts a three class structure, a Director can belong to Class I, Class II or Class III. Some of our Directors will be in Class 1 and will be up for reelection as early as the first year the company is public, while other Directors will not be up for reelection until 2 or 3 years after the company is public. The decision as to which director is in which class is typically made close to when a company goes public. Various factors in making this determination are taken into consideration; for example, some VC Directors may prefer to leave the Board earlier in the public company lifecycle due to the number of commitments or requirements imposed by their respective funds.
