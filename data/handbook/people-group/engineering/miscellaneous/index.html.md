## Team page entry Specialty field

Once/day we run a pipeline that syncs the specialty field for team members within the Engineering and Product division. This means that if team members edit that field in the file, this will result in the sync overwriting when it runs again. The reason for this is that we consider Workday as the single source of truth for this data. Thus team members and managers will need to make adjustments in Workday first and this will be automatically propagated in the team page entry.

To determine what to fill in for the specialty, we first look at the multi-select specialty field. If there is nothing present in
this field, we look at the single select specialty field.

## Parental leave PTO to BambooHR

We run a daily check to see if any new Parental leave PTO was requested for the day before on PTO by Deel. If there are any PTO events created on that day, we will add 3 employment statuses to the team member's BambooHR profile:

- One with the status `Parental Leave` with the date the start date of the PTO event
- One with the status `End of Parental Leave` with the date the end of the PTO event
- One with the status `Active` with the date the end date of the PTO event + 1

## Sensitive data compliant PTO by Deel export

Every week, a scheduled job queries all PTO events occurring during a ±4 week time frame. Sensitive information (eg. the _type_ of PTO taken) is then filtered out from these PTO events. The compliant data is then uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket for the data analytics team to consume.

The data team then makes a subset of this information available via Sisense to allow team members to create more accurate charts for metrics like _number of merge requests per team member over a 30-day period_.

## Netherlands accrual adjustments

A scheduled job runs on January first and for each team member located in the Netherlands, if their `Employee Accruals` balance is negative, it is set back to 0 days.

A similar scheduled job also runs on July first, but in this case, for each team member located in the Netherlands, if their `Employee Accruals` balance exceeds 10 days, it is set back to 10 days.

## Set closed training issues to confidential

Once per day, closed issues in the [training project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/Training) are automatically marked as confidential for compliance.

## Letter of employment

Every hour, a scheduled job checks the letter of employment requests spreadsheet for new entries. For each entry, a letter of employment will be generated using the team member's Workday data. The letter is then sent directly to the team member's work email address.

To retrieve your letter of employment, please use the process in the internal handbook [here](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/frequently_requested/#letter-of-employment).

## Entities sync

Once per week, Workday locations are synced to GitLab groups. Team members are then added to the correct group. The list of groups (entities) can be found in the [entities project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/entities).

When creating a merge request or issue that affects all members of a given GitLab entity, all members with direct membership can be pinged using `@gitlab-com/entities/<entity-name>`.

eg. for Canada Corp, use `@gitlab-com/entities/canada-corp`.

## On-call scheduling spreadsheet

On the first day of each month, we populate a spreadsheet including information for team members who have been at GitLab for more than 3 months. The spreadsheet is used by engineering to plan for on-call availability.

Synced fields are sourced from Workday and the team file.

- Name
- Job title
- Division
- Department
- Subdepartment
- Role
- City
- Country
- State/province
- Weekend availability

## Weekly New hires
Every Wednesday at 10AM UTC, we run the audit on all the team members who started the week before. A spreadsheet is created 
in a Google Drive folder that is shared with Total Rewards and the VP People Operations, Technology & Analytics. In the
spreadsheet we will list all the team members that we audited and mark the columns that need to be checked.

## Monthly all Team Members
Every first of the month at 10AM UTC, we run the audit on all the active team members at GitLab. A spreadsheet is created 
in a Google Drive folder that is shared with Total Rewards and the VP People Operations, Technology & Analytics. In the spreadsheet
we will list all the team members that we audited _and_ that had something marked as _needs to be checked_.
