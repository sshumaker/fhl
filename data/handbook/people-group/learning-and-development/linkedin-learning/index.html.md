## Overview

In January 2021, GitLab implemented LinkedIn Learning to provide our team members with more off the shelf learning resources. With a growing company, the needs for learning are growing as well and we are excited to provide this opportunity to our team members.  

## Benefit of LinkedIn Learning

Utilizing LinkedIn Learning will be beneficial to your personal and professional development. With access to LinkedIn Learning, you will be able to access over 8,000 courses on many different topics. 

### How to incorporate LinkedIn Learning into your day-to-day role 

We encourage all team members to [take time out to learn](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign). If you are working on a project and realize you need to know more about a certain topic or a certain tool, you can go to GitLab Learn and search for LinkedIn Learning couses to see if there are resources avialble to you. 

### Take Time out to Learn

Finding courses and skills to learn just got easier with access to LinkedIn Learning. We have a [take time out to learn campaign](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-initiatives/#take-time-out-to-learn-campaign) where we encourage our team members to take time out of their work week to learn. Focus Fridays create designated meeting-free space within our weeks and are a great opportunity to take time out to learn.

You can take time to learn about something that will help you in your current role. You can learn about things that can help you in a future role (maybe you are an aspiring manager). You can learn more to improve current skills or learn entirely new skills. You can also take time to learn about things that are fun or interesting for you like graphic design, drawing, or mindfulness. 

## Recommended Learning Paths

We have outlined recommended LinkedIn Learning paths for different roles at GitLab. We also have a [Recommended LinkedIn Learning Courses](https://gitlab.edcast.com/channel/recommended-linkedin-learning-courses) channel in GitLab Learn to showcase popular and recommended courses among GitLab Team Members. These links will take you to GitLab Learn and if you decide to take the course it will open a new tab for the course in LinkedIn Learning. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is a good start if you are new to using the tool.

## How to access LinkedIn Learning

Please follow this process for gaining access to a license for paid LinkedIn Learning content: 

1. Go to https://gitlab.okta.com and open `LinkedIn Learning` 
1. You will be asked to login to your LinkedIn account and to give Okta access to your LinkedIn account
1. You will receive an email notification from LinkedIn Learning once you have been added to the system. 
1. To access LinkedIn Learning content, go to https://www.linkedin.com/learning alternatively, go to our learning platform, [GitLab Learn](https://gitlab.edcast.com/) and search for skills or topics you want to learn more about. When you select a LinkedIn Learning course it will open a new tab with the course directly on LinkedIn Learning. 

#### What to do if you receive an error message when trying to redeem a LinkedIn Learning license via Okta

If clicking the above link results when trying to access LinkedIn Learning for the first time results in an error message, this may be because we have reached our limit of available licenses.

In this instance, please:

1. Ensure your GitLab email address is on your LinkedIn Profile  
1. Fill out an [access request](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request)
1. You will receive an email invite when a license next becomes available. Generally a couple of licenses are freed up each week.

If a license is required urgently or during periods of high demand, the [Growth & Development benefit](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/) can be used to expense one.

## Revoking LinkedIn Learning licenses

Due to the limited number of licenses available for team members, the Learning & Development team may periodically revoke licenses from inactive user accounts (Usually accounts that haven't been active in over 6 months). This allows for the licenses to be redistributed to team members who may be able to better utilise them.

Before revoking any LinkedIn Learning license, users will always be notified via email and given the opportunity to log in to their account, which will signal that they would like to retain their license for the time being.

The revoking and redistribution of licenses can only be processed by LinkedIn Learning admins. If you no longer need your license and would like to give it up to be utilised by another team member, please let us know in the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.

## Searching for LinkedIn Learning Courses

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpWhSB-qrF0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## LinkedIn Learning Cohorts

Self-organizing a cohort to complete a LinkedIn Learning course together can be a great way to keep each other accountable, discuss your learning, and connect with new team members. Similar to our [book clubs](/handbook/leadership/book-clubs/), we encourage team members to organize LinkedIn Learning cohorts to learn together.

Use this checklist when organizing your LinkedIn Learning cohort. Here is an example of how the [GitLab Women TMRG organized and implemented a LinkedIn Learning cohort](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/women-tmrg/-/issues/10).

1. Organize a cohort of learners. Consider reaching out to your team, the #what's-happening-at-GitLab channel, or a TMRG you're part of. Pose the opportunity to learn together and see what response you get!
1. Explore courses on LinkedIn Learning. We have suggestions on this page for all team members, but feel free to get specific in an area you're passionate about!
1. Vote or decide on a cousre to take together. 
1. Set a completion goal. Be realistic with how much time you have to learn each week. Consider a 2 or 3 month completion goal.
1. Decide how you want to collaborate. You may want to meet bi-weekly to discuss synchronously or use issues to collabrate async.
1. Build your learning pathway in GitLab Learn. Curate existing LinkedIn Learning SmartCards into the pathway you'd like to create. Consider adding a badge to the pathway as well. Documentation for building pathways can be found in our GitLab Learn admin docs
1. Choose a facilitator. This facilitator is expected to organize discussion issues, set due dates, and send preriodic reminders to the cohort to keep members accountable
1. Create a temporary Slack channel. This space can be used as a place to remind members about upcoming deadlines, plan synchronous calls, and ask questions. 
1. Have a celebration! When you've completed the course, consider having a celebration to recap your learning, share takeaways, and recognize your accomplishments. Share your takeaways and badges on your LinkedIn profile if you'd like!

## Sub Admins

All of our [People Business Partners](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) are set up as sub-admins for the groups they over see. 

We recommend that all sub-admins take the [Getting Started as a LinkedIn Admin](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/). If you do not have time to take the full 1 hour course, here are the videos we recommend watching to learn how to recommend content to your groups and pull reports: 

1. [Recommend Content](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/recommend-content-8370321?u=2255073) (5m)
1. [Create and Share Collections](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/create-and-share-collections-8372286?u=2255073) (7m)
1. [Create and Share Learning Paths](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/create-and-share-learning-paths-8373276?u=2255073) (5m)
1. [Analytics and Reports](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/analytics-and-reports?u=2255073) (4m)
1. [Skill Insights](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-started-as-a-linkedin-learning-admin/skill-insights?u=2255073) (3m)

If you would like to request access to be a sub-admin, please reach out to our team in the `#learninganddevelopment` Slack channel. 

### Reporting

For People Business Partners that are helping groups track LinkedIn usage for OKR purposes or otherwise, these are steps that can be followed after sub-admin access is provisioned. 

1. Login to LinkedIn Learning
1. Hover over the `Insights` tab at the top of the page, and then click `Dashboards`
1. Click on the `Reports` tab

From here, the report you download will depend on exactly what you are looking to track. LinkedIn Learning has many different reports available depending on the data you are looking to analyize. 

A couple of useful reports and their functionality are:
1. `Learner Management` report can help determine the number of team members in a given division/department with activated licenses (and also provides visibilty into who _does not_ have their license activated)
1. `Learner Summary` report can help you review which users in a specific group are using LinkedIn Learning, hours spent within the platform, number of logins, etc.


## Groups and Sub-Groups

In LinkedIn Learning we have set up groups and sub-groups. The groups are equal to departments in Workday. The sub-groups under each group are equal to divisions within each department in Workday. 

Sub-admins are set up for each group and sub-group based on the [People Business Partner alignment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division). 

Current groups and sub-groups are outlined below:

### Updating Groups

We utilize this [google sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10vbUvv-iAA1Mx1X_zousfSTxoDf8KnPJ0ROGpbiU2w8/edit#gid=0) for uploading data with a CSV file.
