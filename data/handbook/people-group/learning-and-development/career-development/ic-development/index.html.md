## Career development for Individual Contributors (ICs) at GitLab

This page is meant to act as a map or menu for individual contributors who are looking for guidance on what Learning and Development programs to participate in during their time at GitLab. It can be customized, added to, or scaled back based on specific goals for each team member.

References to `Year 1`, `Year 2`, etc. in the outline below are meant to indicate tenure at GitLab specifically, not entire career length as an individual contributor.
