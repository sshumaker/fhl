# Learning Evangelist Training
<!-- blank line -->

This training is designed for team members who would like to create their own learning content in Level Up. Once you've completed the course, let the Learning & Development team know and we'll uplift your permissions and allocate you a number of content items to give you access to the system.

This handbook page is used to document the Level Up Learning Evangelist Training. The Learning & Development team use a [handbook first](/people-group/learning-and-development/interactive-learning/) approach to interactive learning, so the content in this page can also be found in the Level Up course, but is preserved here as a Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

## Switching between admin and learner views

When your permissions are uplifted, you will be granted access to the admin side of the platform. This video shows you how to switch between the Learner and Admin views, so that you can create content, but also still navigate the platform as a regular learner.

# Notes for Admins

For Level Up administrators, once a user has completed this course, they should let you know they have done so and that they are ready to have their permissions uplifted. You'll then need to complete the following actions:

- First, confirm the completion by checking to see if the course is showing as `completed` in their learner profile.
- If they are showing as completed, navigate to the `Role` section within the `Details` tab of the user profile.
- From the `New Role` dropdown, select `Course Author`. Then, under `Dual Role` click `Create learner profile`.
- Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Save`.

This enables the Dual Role for the user.
