**Please note that the next Manager Challenge has been paused until further notice.**

Team member can reach out in the [#learninganddevelopment Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/CMRAWQ97W) with any questions about upcoming manager training or utilize their [Growth and Development benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/) for external training opportunities.

You can learn more about our current manager development program on our [Elevate handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/elevate/). 

## Introduction

Developing mangerial skills is no small task. While taking on a new or expanded role as a manager brings great rewards, it also introudces new challenges. To be successful as a manager it requires management training that develops your ability to lead a functioning team while implementing management skills and abilities such as adaptive leadership, building trust, psychological safety, and conflict resolution. 

The Manager Challenge addresses your specific needs to understand the qualities of a good leader and to master practical leadership styles that empower you to become a confident people leader. Effective leadership is grounded in your understanding of powerful interpersonal skills that inspire performance, communication, team member retention, and motivation to achieve results. 

### Leadership Development Award   

The program was awarded a Gold Excellence in Leadership Development by the [Brandon Hall Group for the Best Unique and Innovative Leadership Development Program](http://www.brandonhall.com/excellenceawards/excellence-leadership.php?year=2021#BestUniqueorInnovativeLeadershipProgram). Brandon Hall operates the largest and longest running awards in Human Capital Management. The GitLab program was evaluated by a panel of learning and development veterans, senior industry experts, analysts, and executives. L&D is thrilled to have been recognized for this achievement!

### Team Member Time Investment Level

If you plan to participate in the Manager Challenge, please discuss with your manager. Let them know you are interested and will be dedicating the three weeks to actively participating. This is not like the [CEO Shadow program](/handbook/ceo/shadow/), but the Manager Challenge will **require a heavy time investment**. If you plan to participate, try to do everything you can to block one to two hours each day during the program. This is an intensive program with the goal of covering a lot of material in a short amount of time to increase knowledge retention. **There will be more synchronous activities, less async, this challenge due to feedback from past participants.**

Make the program part of your [career development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/), and include in your [Individual Growth Plan](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources-1).

L&D is making some significant changes to the program in the meantime, but expect to dedicate at least **five to seven hours per week**. Some participants, request additional time to complete the async activities so please plan accordingly. You must attend and/or complete at least 80% of the activities to be awarded a certification. 

All details relating to the next iteration of the Manager Challenge program can be found on this page.

### Overview

**What** 

The Manager Challenge Program is a blended learning approach that incorporates self-paced learning and live learning sessions to build management skills to lead all-remote teams. The program incorporates leadership assessments, interactive live learning sessions, and digital learning. 

**Why** 

The program is intended to build a set of baseline skills that complement our values to enable Managers to lead teams at GitLab. 

**How will it help**

Learn the basic principles of what it means to be a manager using a whole-person approach to leadership. The curriculum was built using principles from the book High Output Management, interviews with senior leaders, and GitLab management practices. 

**What do I need to do**

Set aside time each day to participate in the challenge (1 hour) and live learning sessions (1 hour 20 minutes). Complete the weekly learning evaluations, comment on the challenge issues, and fill your individual growth plan. If you are unable to prioritize the training for the 2 weeks, please consider signing up for a session at a later date or discuss additional options with the L&D team. In addition, there will also be async learning options for participants that are unable to attend the live learning sessions.

### Individual Growth Plan

Throughout the program, we ask that managers to create or refine their [Individual Growth Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources-1). We encourage Managers to self-reflect on their professional development as a people leader and identify areas where they can advance their skills. 
The document is intended to be a starting point for managers to document where they can improve as a people leader.

## Testimonials

What people leaders at GitLab learned during the program: 

1. "It's okay to make mistakes. I'm not ashamed to say this but there are managers that participated in this challenge that I almost idolized and thought wow, they are the perfect manager. But then I hear concerns and fears they have and it makes me realize no one is perfect. We are all just trying to be the best we can be and that's all we can do."
2. "Managing is all about the team, its members, and the results generated by trust and collaboration fostered from its own members. A manager's job is to create an environment where trust and collaboration can thrive, set the vision, and serve the members in removing any obstacles allowing them to grow into the best possible version of themselves."
3. "The handbook has so much content, its easy to forget how much tactical information can be found right at your fingertips."
4. "Team performance is cyclical. Perceived regressions aren't bad, but rather a reflection of change in team dynamics. Look for the types of questions people are asking to know how to respond."
5. "The handbook is a great resource with tons of information on being a manager, having hard conversations, and helping teams grow."
6. "For me, these are good reminders of what are the best practices to adopt as a Manager.  I am always exploring, what are ways we can do tasks better and faster.  With that said, as a manager, we need to be sure my people and others are part of the process."
7. "I learned that there are so many amazing managers here at GitLab. Each of the days' comments were treasure troves into how to approach something differently or new techniques that others have found success with."
8. "If you are struggling with something, chances are that other managers have faced the same challenges, so it's good to connect with others and learn from each other!"
9. "A person's culture has tangible impacts on what they hear. Therefore, tailoring a message needs to account for the knowledge and skills of the person as well as account for their cultural background. In other words, there's no such thing as one-size-fits-all communication."
10. "It's possible to be a great remote manager"

## Learning and Development Team 

### Organizing Epics and Issues 

The Manager Challenge Pilot is set up within the GitLab Tool. We are using Epics, Sub Epics, and Issues. There is one main Epic for the whole program, a Sub Epic for each week, and then an Issue for each day. 

**Example of Manager Challenge Pilot Set Up:**

[Manager Challenge Pilot - Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1)

[Week 1 - Manager Challenge Pilot - Sub Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/2)

[Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge)

[Manager Challenge Program Pilot: Day 1 - Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/issues/1)

**Learning & Development Team Tasks** 

- A week before the program starts: 
   - Create the Epic: Manager Challenge - [Month] [Year] 
   - Create the Sub Epics for each week: Manager Challenge - Week 1 
- Daily
   - Create the Day's Issue in the [Manager Challenge Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge) using the [manager-challenge-daily-template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/manager-challenge/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/manager-challenge-daily-template.md) 
   - Monitor the issue comments to respond to questions as well as keep track of participation 

### Communication 

The modes of communication during the challenge include Slack and GitLab. Ensure that there is a specific channel in Slack set up for challenge members, as well as a group tag in GitLab. 

Each day, once the issue is opened, add the group tag to the issue so participants receive an email notification that the daily issue is ready. For the pilot, the tag was `@gl-manager-challenge-pilot`. 

The Slack channel for the pilot program was `#manager-challenge-pilot`. Each day, once the issue was opened, a message was posted in the Slack channel with a link to the day's issue. 

### Scheduling 

**Live Learning Sessions** 

Each week of the challenge has one day of live learning sessions. Depending on the locations of the participants, it can be determined how many sessions are held on the Thursday of each week.  

Approximate times for the live sessions to ensure timezone coverage include: 7:30 am PT, 1:00 pm PT, and 6:30 pm PT. 

### Retrospective Sessions

After the challenge has been completed, it is suggested to have a live retrospective where participants can come and share any feedback about the program. The time(s) this is scheduled for can be the same as the live learning sessions were during the challenge. 

For the pilot Manager Challenge program, the Learning & Development team held a [retrospective session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecuYFRA2oMqpXbGeaK-VIB8AeX98dJJ2-W-wcYUzaXg/edit?userstoinvite=nadia%40gitlab.com&ts=5f7eb88b) to discuss with participants how we can iterate and improve the program moving forward. [Anonymous feedback and ratings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUqcs-kSmXf1ol_lio7TJYcn7VHEGHrNcacW3KQwyKg/edit#gid=314035882) were captured throughout the pilot challenge. Each week participants filled out a learning evaluation form for the weekly challenges and overall program.
