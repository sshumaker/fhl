## Mini-Challenge

Mini-challenges are 1 week learning opportunities that utilitze a combination of GitLab issues, live learning sessions, and Slack to organize a group of learners around a specific topic. Mini-challenges are advertised to team members via slack and require interested learners to opt in. Participation in issue discussion questions and in live learning sessions (synchronous and asynchronous) are is tracked by the L&D team or challenge organizer. Upon completion of the challenge, participants are awareded a certification. The L&D team has used the mini-challenge model to engage learners on topics like psychological safety.

In addition to the use of GitLab, each mini-challenge includes a dedicated Slack channel to organize conversation, share new issue links, and provide space for team members to ask questions.

Examples of current and past challanges can be found in the [Learning and Development project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/challenges)

### GitLab Mini and Extended Challenges

All of GitLab's Learning and Development programs use the [GitLab tool to facilitate learning](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/-/epics/1). One way we do that is with the use of daily challenges. Daily challenges are a proven strategy for implementing new habits for our team members. Daily challenges can cover a range of topics, and they are intended to introduce behavior changes that will stick. In September of 2020, we launched a [Four Week Manager Challenge program](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-challenge/) that consisted of daily challenges and live learning events to strengthen foundational management skills. In November of 2020, we launched a [One Week Challenge on Psychological Safety](/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/#one-week-challenge). 

**Sample structure of a challenge:**
- Length of challenge: 1 week (But can be for as long as 4 weeks)
- Sample challenge topic: Giving Feedback
- Daily challenges: 20-minute daily challenge (Monday through Friday)
- Live Learning: Optional live learning session at the end of the week to revisit the challenges covered
- Self-Reflection: At the end of the week, have participants complete a self-reflection exercise
- Certification/Badging: Option to award participants with a certification or badge
