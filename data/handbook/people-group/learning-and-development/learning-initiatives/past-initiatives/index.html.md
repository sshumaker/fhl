## Past Initiatives

### Monthly Continuous Learning Call Overview

The Learning and Development (L&D) team previously hosted a monthly Monthly Continuous Learning call. The series was intended to showcase all of the L&D initatives taking place at GitLab as well as provide a space for team members to ask questions. The series was replaced in FY22 with involvement in company-wide Group Conversations in an effor to increase participation and attendance in the calls.

#### Goals

1. Spur a culture of curiosity and continuous learning by highlighting all the initiatives we have taking place in learning & development.
1. Increase engagement and improve team member satisfaction and productivity by advancing understanding of available L&D resources

Additional background information on this initiaitve is available in the [Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/96)

#### Hosting a Monthly Continuous Learning Call

The following process outlines steps for the L&D team to take each month when planning and implementing monthly calls.

**Planning Issue Template:** Open an Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue template in the L&D Project. Steps outlined below are also included in the issue template and are included here as reference.

1. Post in the [#people-connect Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C02360SQQFR) to coordinate a Zoom meeting on the company calendar. This meeting should be set up to live stream to the GitLab unfiltered YouTube channel. Consider hosting the call at least 2 times to best accommodate for multiple time zones.
1. Create slide deck for presentation. Make a copy of a previous month's presention in the [Continuous Learning Campaign Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4ksJXBMrATATxN0QyJ4FA6hzchMNdvb?usp=sharing)
1. Coordinate slide deck with appropriate enablement audiences (i.e DIB, Field Enablement, Professional Services, Marketing Enablement, etc)
1. Update slide deck for presentation with feedback from coordinated audiences
1. Open a feedback issue for questions and comments to be shared asynchronously.
1. Coordinate an announcement of the call in the #company-fyi Slack channel from Sid or another executive/manager who will be featured that month. The post should be shared 1 business day before the call. This post should include a link to the slide deck and coresponding issue. See notes below for a template that can be shared.
