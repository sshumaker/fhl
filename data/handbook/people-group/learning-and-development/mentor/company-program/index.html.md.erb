## Program structure

| Program Title | Description |
| ----- | --------------- |
| **Mentor/Mentee Training** | Completion of the self-paced [How to be a Good Mentor or Mentee](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/how-to-be-a-good-mentee-and-mentor/the-power-of-mentoring?u=2255073) course is **required** of all mentors and mentees. If you prefer text-based learning or don't have a LinkedIn Learning license, you can instead review [these slides](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#mentor-and-mentee-training). We ask that all mentors and mentees also complete the [DIB training certification](https://levelup.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.gitlab.com/courses/dib-training-certification) prior to the start of the program. |
| **Initial program kickoff** | Async kickoff discussion with mentors and mentees. Participation is **strongly encouraged**. |
| **Mentorship Sessions** | Mentors and mentees meet sync or async every other week for ~30-minutes for a total 5 months, _(with the option to extend)_. Sessions are led by the mentee and should be focused on specific goals. Participation is **required**.|
| **Mentor/Mentee Workbook** | [Mentorship resources](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#resources) are available for all mentor/mentee pairs, including suggested articles, strategies for goal setting, and sample meeting agendas. Use of resources is **encouraged**. |
| **End of Program Celebration and Feedback** | Async discussion to share mentorship success. Participation is **strongly encouraged**. An end of program feedback form will be shared with all mentors and mentees and is **required.** |


### Async First Mentorship

This program includes an opt-in, async first structure to increase opportunity for team members in any time zone to pair with mentors company-wide. Async-first means that mentees can pair with mentors in any time zone. In order to be paired in an async mentorship, both mentor and mentee must opt in while applying.

**Async first mentorship pairs should consider the following:**

1. Connect every other week using a GitLab issue, Google doc, Slack messages or voice memos, and/or Loom recorded videos. Remember that async does **not** have to mean text only. See this example of [async meeting formats](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#sample-async-meeting-formats).
1. Consider finding 1-3 times over the course of the 5-month program to meet synchrousnouly, even if just for 15 minutes. This will require advance planning for both mentor and mentee and is not required.
1. Utilize all async resources provided on the [mentorship](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/#resources) handbook page.

## FAQ

**Can I participate as both a mentor and a mentee?**

Yes, this is a possibility. It's important that team members talk with their managers to discuss their capacity to participate in both roles in this program. Participation in both roles will require a 2hr commitment per month (two 30 minute sessions as a mentor and two 30 minute sessions as a mentee).

It's possible that we will have a shortage of mentors and be unable to complete all mentor/mentee pairs. If there is a shortage of mentors and you've applied as both a mentor and a mentee, you will be assigned **only** as a mentor in this program. 

**I'd like to participate but I can't commit the entire length of the program. Can I still apply?**

If you cannot commit to the 5 month program, please consider applying for a future mentorship program at GitLab. It's important that both mentors and mentees are available for the full 5 month program to achieve the best results.

**I'm not eligible to be a mentor or a mentee in this program. What are my options for future participation?**

Team members are always encouraged to build mentor/mentee relationships independently. You can find resources and a list of available mentors in the [Learning and Development handbook](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/)
