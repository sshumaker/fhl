## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning & Development (L&D) page at GitLab! L&D is an essential part of any organization's growth, success, and overall business strategy. We want to support the growth of our GitLab team-members' competencies, skills, and knowledge by providing them with the tools they need and the opportunities to progress their own personal and professional development. 

## Compliance Courses 

GitLab has several compliance courses and resources. Explore the chart below to learn more. 

| Training     | Tool  | Frequency   |  Responsible Team   | 
|---------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|  
| [Anti-Harassment](/handbook/anti-harassment/)    | WILL Interactive | Onboarding <br> Varies based on Location | Learning & Development |

## WILL Interactive

All team members, regardless of location, are required to take harassment prevention training. All new team members will have a task during their onboarding to complete this training using [Will Interactive's Platform](https://learning.willinteractive.com/) within the first 30 days of hire. Additionally, on all new team members' 6th day with GitLab, they will receive a Slack message reminder to complete the training. 

Once you get to that step in your onboarding, please do the following:

Please review our [Anti-Harassment Policy](/handbook/anti-harassment/) which outlines guidelines, reporting, and disciplinary action. 

We have four separate trainings, but you only need to complete **one** of them. For managers, leaders ([job grade](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#job-grades) 10+), and all team members in Connecticut (regardless of role), the course is 2 hours long. For all other GitLab Team Members, the course is 1 hour long. There are separate courses for U.S. and non-U.S. due to states in the U.S. requiring a "gated" course. You do not need to complete the course in one sitting as you can stop and come back to it. Just ensure it is completed within your first 30 days at GitLab. Click on the Harassment Prevention training that aligns with your role (Supervisor or Team Member) and location (U.S. or Non-U.S.): 

| Your Role     | Your Location  | Course to Take  |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|

### Processing Steps for L&D Team

#### Tracking 

The L&D Team performs bi-weekly audits of team members that have completed the training. This will be done by opening an issue in the Learning & Development [general project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues) and following the steps outlined in the `anti-harassment-training-tracking` [issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/anti-harassment-training-tracking.md). 

#### Checking WILL Interactive for Offboarded Team Members

When tagged in an offboarding issue, follow these steps to check the completion/license status of appropriate anti-harassment courses in the WILL Learning platform.

The following steps are outlined in this [private recording that can be found in the L&D Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dQPL321XtliHdzo8fuwxqcX9f8maaM-b/view?usp=sharing). 

This step must be completed for each offboarding issue, as GitLab pays per license in WILL Learning. This compliance check ensures that GitLab is aware of, and making use of, all paid licenses.

1. Navigate to the offboarding issue. Copy the user's email address.
1. Collect Start Date: Linked to the offboarding issue is a merge request to remove the team member from relevant pages. Review the MR change log to check the start date of the team member. This start date will indicate which WILL Learning course the team member would have completed.
1. Collect Location Information: On the same MR, make note of the team member's location.
1. Collect Management Information: On the offboarding issue, check for the individual's title at GitLab and determine if they were a manager of people. If you cannot tell from the offboarding issue, check their Slack profile or refer to the GitLab Org Chart.
1. Open the WILL Learning platform.
1. Based on the team member's location, management level, and start date, navigate to the WILL Learning course, they would have been invited to take. For example, a team member who manages people joined GitLab in 2019, and lives outside of the USA would have been invited to take the `2019 Anti-Harassment Training for Supervisors` course. Click the `MANAGE` button to enter the course.
1. Check for Completion: The following steps should be taken to determine the current status of the individual's WILL Learning license - either `Finished`, `In Progress`, or `Not Started`. Please note - if the user does not appear in the first WILL Learning course you check, attempt to look for the user in other appropriate courses. Note that at this time, there is no function in the WILL Learning platform to search all courses at once.

     1. If a search for the user's email address returns a `Finished` status, check the de-provisioned box on the offboarding issue and comment on the issue `WILL Learning course finished, no license to revoke`
     1. If a search for the user's email address returns an `In Progress` status, check the de-provisioned box on the offboarding issue and comment on the issue `WILL Learning in progress, cannot revoke license`. Email our WILL Learning account representative to request a refund of the license.
     1. If a search for the user's email address returns a `Not Started` status, check the de-provisioned box on the offboarding issue and comment on the issue `WILL Learning in progress, cannot revoke license`. Email our WILL Learning account representative to request a refund of the license.
     1. If a search for the user's email address returns no results, follow the next steps to revoke the license.

1. Revoke License: The following steps should be taken if you cannot find a record of the course status for the offboarding team member.

     1. Within the appropriate WILL Learning course, click `Invite Participants`
     1. Under the `Pending Invitations` section, click `View All`
     1. Search the page using the team member's email address
     1. If the user's name appears in the `Pending Invitations` section, click the `revoke` link to remove their access to the license
     1. On the offboarding issue, check the de-provisioned box and comment on the issue `WILL Learning course not started, license revoked`

1. When you have completed this process, be sure to shut off notifications on the offboarding issue to avoid inbox noise.

#### Supporting New Managers of People at GitLab

When new team members join the GitLab team as managers of people, the L&D team reminds them to take the assigned WILL Learning anti-harassment course.

1. The employment bot will open a new issue for team members who are joining as managers of people
1. Comment on this issue and tag the new manager with a friendly reminder to take their anti-harassment WILL Learning course.
1. You can use the steps in the `Checking Compliance for Offboarded Team Members` section to determine if the new manager has completed the course
1. If the user has already completed the course, consider posting a friendly thanks on their employment issue.
1. Unfollow the employment issue to avoid future inbox noise.

#### Supporting Transitioning team members to Managers of People

When current team members transition to roles and become managers of people, the L&D team assigns a new anti-harassment course in WILL Learning for the team member to complete.

1. The employment bot will open a new issue for team members who are transitioning to managers of people
1. Find the user's location using their Slack or GitLab profile
1. In WILL Learning, navigate to the appropriate training for supervisors based on this geographical area.
1. In the course, click `Invite Participants` and copy the shareable link
1. On the employment issue, comment using the following template: `Hello [NAME]! Please follow this link [COURSE LINK] to complete  the [COURSE NAME] in WILL Learning. Thanks!`
1. Follow the steps above in the `Checking Compliance for Offboarded Team Members` section to determine if this team member has completed the individual anti-harassment course in their previous role. If they did not complete the course, follow the steps to revoke their license.

### Payment Process

Please follow the payment process outlined on the [coupa handbook page](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/) starting at [how to create a requisition](/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/guides/coupa-guide/#how-to-create-a-requisition) when purchasing new licenses from WILL Interactive. Before you start the process in Coupa, you will need to request an invoice from WILL Interactive. 

If you have questions throughout the process, reach out to the Senior Accounts Payable Specilaist via the `#finance` Slack channel.
