## Overview
Leadership development is one of the key L&D priorities and also a People Group OKR. To enable our continued growth at scale, we need to equip our people leaders with the needed skills to lead all-remote teams in a globally dispersed organization.

The handbook provides guidance on GitLab [leadership competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#manager-and-leadership-competencies) and principles. Bringing these practices to life requires training and practice. To provide an opportunity for each people leader to learn to lead effectively at GitLab, we are launching a new leadership development program called Elevate. 

## What is Elevate

Elevate is a highly interactive, all virtual program where you will learn with each other, and from each other. The goal is to provide a common, well understood leadership framework which demonstrates GitLab values, leadership competencies, and mission. 

In the Elevate program, you will:
- Learn what it means to lead at GitLab
- Practice the [Manager & Leadership competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#manager-and-leadership-competencies)
- Apply what you are learning into practice via an action learning project
- Build cross-functional relationships with your coaching cohort members
- Demonstrate leadership competency by completing Elevate Leadership Certification

## Time Commitment

Participants are expected to spend a total of 3-4 hours per month participating in the following learning activities:
- Attend one instructor lead learning session and learn the critical concepts each month for 6 months (50 minutes per month).
- Following each lesson, complete self-paced learning such as videos, reading, journaling and quizzes (45 minutes per month).
- Participate in your 15-member, cross functional group coaching cohort to practice that monthâ€™s concepts (80 minutes per month).
- Complete an action learning group project which demonstrates the impact of your leadership (30 minutes per month).
- Provide robust feedback on the program to help us iterate on the content and delivery.

## Enrollment 

We plan to launch the Elevate program for a pilot group in FY23-Q4 and then roll out the program for all GitLab people managers throughout FY24.
