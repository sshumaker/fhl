# Talent Assessment Program 
 
### Purpose

The purpose of the Talent Assessment Program is to identify and retain team members who drive the success of our organization. This is a top priority and strategic process for people managers at GitLab. Our Talent Assessment Program (which is a critical piece of our overall [Talent Development Program](/handbook/people-group/talent-development-program/)) serves as a mechanism to help mitigate a couple of our biggest concerns: [lack of performance management](/handbook/leadership/mitigating-concerns/#underperformance) and [losing key people](/handbook/leadership/mitigating-concerns/#key-people-leave). 

Additional key benefits of the Assessment Program include:

- Help facilitate career development conversations (and ensure they're occurring regularly)
- Ensure transparency and ongoing feedback between team members and their managers
- Discuss promotion readiness and plan promotions
- Succession planning
- Increase awareness of top talent across departments (during calibration sessions)

### Overview 

Starting in FY'23, we will utilize Workday to complete our Talent Assessment. You can review an overview of Workday Talent [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CYNNtYWvbDyDu_WndCQ47uvTbZYhNKt5PJLnrwZ_3ek/edit?usp=sharing). Please reach out to your [People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) if you have any questions.
You can also review the following [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khkrwgVpef1hkDmwuF8Mhz9BTrtZt4WaFAwjChDFRh4/edit?usp=sharing) which mirrors what is included in the Workday Talent Assessment template to prepare you prior to the tool being launched. 

There are many talent assessment options, and we have opted to use a Performance/Growth Potential Matrix (commonly known as "9-Box" in the US) and annually review Key Talent. 

GitLab's Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is a type of talent assessment that forms part of our [Talent Development Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-development-program/). 

In addition to assessing Performance/Growth Potential, we annually review Key Talent aligned with the criteria outlined below on this page. The combination of Performance/Growth Potential and Key Talent assessments allow us to identify team members who drive the organization’s success and use our engagement tools to retain them. 

# The Performance/Growth Potential Matrix

| Performance ↑ <br> Growth Potential →  | **Developing Growth Potential** | **Growing Growth Potential** | **Exceeding Growth Potential** |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Exceeding** | **Box 5** Team member is performing well in their current job but needs to continue to grow in current role, or has not exhibited the willingness or ability to grow in the current role.| **Box 2** Team member performs well in their current job, makes valuable contributions and consistently demonstrates competencies required. They have shown willingness and/or ability to further grow in their role and they may be ready to take on additional responsibilities in the next 12 months. | **Box 1** Team member is developing faster than the demands of their current position and/or division. Team member has been given additional assignments and has demonstrated high-level commitment/achieved significant results. Team member is ready to broaden their skill set and take on significantly greater scope and responsibility |
| **Performing** | **Box 7** Team member is currently meeting expectations of their role. Team member is not willing or able to absorb greater scope, impact or complexity. | **Box 4** Team member is currently meeting expectations and has shown willingness or ability to further grow; may not be ready to absorb greater scope, impact or complexity in the next 12 months. | **Box 3** Team member is contributing as expected and is meeting performance expectations. They have shown willingness and/or ability to further grow in their role and they may be ready to take on additional responsibilities in the near future. |
| **Developing** | **Box 9** Team member is not meeting performance expectations and there is still more to learn in the current position, **or**, team member has not been in the position long enough (promotion, new to the role, or new hire) to adequately demonstrate the pillars of growth potential for a sustained period of time. | **Box 8** Team member has not been in the position long enough to adequately demonstrate their capacity (promotion, new to the role, or new hire), or may have lost pace with changes in the organization. The team member has shown the willingness and/or ability to grow in the role aligned with the pillars of growth or has had opportunity to consistently demonstrate performance and growth potential. | **Box 6** The team member is not meeting the requirements of their current role, but has demonstrated willingness and ability to extend beyond scope once ramped, and/or is showing the willingness and ability to grow further with additional guidance or direction. The team member could be more successful in the current role with more direction/time to ramp, or in another role or department that more appropriately suits their skill set.|

This matrix is an individual assessment tool that evaluates both a team members current contribution to the organization and their potential level of contribution.
It is commonly used in succession planning as a method of evaluation an organization's talent pool, identifying potential leaders, and identifying any gaps or risks.
It is regularly considered a catalyst for robust dialogue (through a calibration process) and is considered more accurate than one person's opinion.
The performance/growth potential matrix can be a diagnostic tool for career development.

The matrix serves as a tool to help managers assess, develop, and coach their team members - ultimately resulting in an ability to more effectively and efficiently lead teams.

## What is "Performance"?

Performance includes both results and behaviors, and is broken into three areas: Developing, Performing, and Exceeding.

### Developing

**Please note that `Developing` should not be automatically associated with underperformance. As highlighted below, `Developing` can also be used for new hires or newly promoted team members that are still ramping up in their new roles. Your manager will provide example and detail to ensure the rationale behind the `Developing` rating is communicated.**

Based on the Job Family responsibilities, [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies) and [remote working competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies), team members in this category are not meeting all of the expectations. There is still more to learn and improve on in the current position to achieve the desired results. This may be due to the following: 

- The team member has not been in the position/at GitLab long enough to adequately demonstrate performance.
- The team member has been recently promoted and needs time to ramp up performance in the new role. 
- The team member may have lost pace with changes in the organization. 
- The team member is not committed to the job responsibilities and/or GitLab. 
- The team member finds it difficult to perform work in a way that is aligned with our values and/or competencies. 
- The team member's performance is aligned to our values and competencies, however, they lack results for Job Family responsibilities. 
- Team member was part of a recent [transfer](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#department-transfers) and is still learning how to be successful on their new team.

Examples: 

- The team member needs a lot of guidance from the manager with the majority of tasks to understand requirements and deliverables expected.
- The team member has not been in the position long enough to adequately demonstrate their capacity. For example, the team member was recently promoted or has changed roles and needs more time to ramp up.
- The team member is missing important due dates which is affecting the team, GitLab and/or customers. 
- The team member still needs to adapt remote working best practices. For example, the team member does not manage their own time or work to achieve results or may have difficulty with asynchronous communication. 
- The team member lacks (a part of) the knowledge, skills and abilities which are required for the role, resulting in a low quality of work being delivered.
- There is a significant mis-alignment (I.E. The team member struggles to collaborate with others, the team member does not work iteratively and key metrics are impacted, etc.) 

### Performing

Based on Job Family responsibilities, [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies) and [remote working competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies) team members in this category are “on track” and meeting all expectations. They can independently and competently perform all aspects of the Job Family responsibilities in a way that is aligned with our values and competencies. Their performance consistently meets the requirements, standards, or objectives of the job, and they can occasionally exceed expectations. They deliver results in a timely and accurate fashion. This performance may be expected as a result of: 

- The team member is consistent and stable in their performance.  
- The team member has the required knowledge, skills and abilities to perform in the role successfully and also applies values and competencies in their work.
- The team member has adapted to remote working and their knowledge, skills, and abilities align seamlessly to their role at GitLab. 

Examples: 
- Team member is a dependable member of the team. Their manager can trust them to achieve key metrics.
- Team member consistently works in accordance with our value and remote working competencies. 
- While consistently meeting expectations, the team member does not regularly exceed expectations.
- Team member does not frequently express interest in additional projects, responsibilities, or work outside of their immediate scope.
- The team member is exemplifying our values in their work, but might have some competencies to improve on. 

### Exceeding

Team members that are exceeding consistently surpass the demands of their current position. They demonstrate unique understanding of work beyond the assigned area of responsibility. They contribute to GitLab’s success by adding significant value well beyond Job Family requirements, [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies), and [remote working competencies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies). This performance may be expected as a result of: 

- Individual is developing more quickly than the demands of their current position. 
- They rise to the challenge when give additional assignments and achieve significant results.
- A “go-to” team member for their peers for tough problems and day-to-day guidance.
- High commitment and engagement to GitLab combined with extensive knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform in the role. 

Examples: 

- Constantly seeks opportunities to improve both self and organization. 
- The team members exemplify great ways of giving and receiving feedback - incorporating this directly in their work. 
- The team members are ambassadors for the values, take full ownership of delivering projects, and very rarely miss due dates. 

**Please note that an `Exceeding` assessment for the performance factor does not guarantee a promotion. While the performance factor is a consideration, there are several considerations that are reviewed when evaluating promotion readiness. Please work with your manager to align expectations.** 

### Expected Distribution Performance/Growth Potential Company-Wide

Note that this is an expected distribution, not a forced distribution. The bell curve distribution aligns with what is most commonly used as a benchmark in the industry and serves as a baseline for us to review and calibrate against. There may be exceptions that are justified that can be discussed and reviewed during calibration. Where deviations from the expected distribution occur, managers should use this as a data point to further review and work with their leadership to ensure appropriate growth plans are in place, proper role fit exists, hiring plans are adjusted, that we are promoting at a fair and accurate rate.

Performance: 
- **Developing**: 10-15%, not yet meeting all of the expectations 
- **Performing**: 60-65%, “on track” and meeting expectations 
- **Exceeding**: 25%, consistently surpasses the demands of their current role

Growth Potential:
- **Developing**: 10-15%
- **Growing**: 60-65%
- **Exceeding**: 25%


Remember that "Developing" for Performance and Growth Potential should not be automatically associated with underperformance, and that many newly promoted team members and new hires fall into this category.


### The Performance Factor

While the primary objective of the performance axis of the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is to calibrate team member performance, this axis of the matrix also directly impacts the [Performance Factor](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor), which is a determining factor in the annual compensation review. Please reference the [Total Rewards Performance Factor page](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor) for more detail on compensation impact.

### Measuring Performance

How can managers determine whether their team members are Developing, Performing, or Exceeding? "The Performance Factor" is determined from several components outlined below. It is _optional_ to use [The Performance Factor Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHe-Vb6y6F4HXsek3sObV4IVNAGaTvXGi_9fbatT0Uo/edit#gid=241716076) for weighing the different Performance Factors.

#### Job Family Responsibilities and Functional Competencies

Performance against Job Family responsibilities, requirements, performance indicators, and functional competencies (if applicable) should be weighted at 60%. 

* Review Job Families: Look at the Responsibilities section and how your team member is performing against those responsibilities 
    * Example: [Software Engineer in Test](/job-families/engineering/software-engineer-in-test/#responsibilities)
* Review Performance indicators per Job Family: Look at the Performance indicators.
    * Example: [Software Engineer in Test](/job-families/engineering/software-engineer-in-test/#performance-indicators)
* _(if applicable)_ [Functional Competencies](/handbook/competencies/#functional-competencies)

For management roles, please also review and consider the [levels](/company/team/structure/#levels) outlined in the Organizational Structure. 

#### GitLab Competencies

Performance against these competencies should be weighted at 40%. 

* [Values Competencies](/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies)
* [Remote Working Competencies](/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies)
* [Job Frameworks](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#job-frameworks)
* _(if applicable)_ [Manager and Leadership Competencies](/handbook/competencies/#manager-and-leadership-competencies) 

## What is "Growth Potential"?

While performance is focused on the past and present, growth potential is focused on the future. Because of the nature of the future-focus associated with growth potential, it is more difficult to measure than performance, and inherently more qualitative than quantitative. A key element in determining growth potential is the manager and leadership observation and experience working with team members. Managers can gauge team member growth potential against the expectations in their current role or their growth potential to take on different roles across GitLab. 

Growth potential refers to the ability and desire of a team member to successfully assume increasingly more broad or complex responsibilities and learn new skills, as compared to peers and the roles' responsibilities outlined in their respective Job Family. This could include the growth potential to move up to the next level in their job family, and/or a lateral move. 

The Growth Potential assessment helps managers determine the best growth trajectory for their team members. The growth potential assessment will be used as input to leverage our engagement tools, offer lateral and upwards career opportunities and do succession planning.

Growth Potential *can change* over time as team members develop new interests, as new opportunities for growth arise, and as team members continue to broaden their knowledge, skills, and abilities. 

### Measuring Growth Potential

There are four primary pillars to consider when measuring growth potential:

| "Growth Potential" Pillar | Definition |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Adaptability | Demonstrating a willingness and ability to learn new skills and apply them to be successful under new, tough, or difficult conditions. Ability to navigate uncertainty and be flexibile with change. |
| Expandability | Expandability outside their areas (laterally or vertically), with the willingness and ability to take on a role of greater complexity, impact, and scope |
| Consistency | Demonstrating effective problem-solving capabilities, the consistent delivery of results over time in changing circumstances, and dependability in the commitments you make. |
| Self-Awareness | The depth to which an individual recognizes skills, strengths, weaknesses, blind spots, and is able to reflect and act to improve and invest in their own development. Judgment in decision-making is also a key element of self-awareness. Judgment can be seen through our level of self-awareness in several ways, including communication, collaboration, and results. Judgment can be defined as "The ability to make considered decisions or come to well thought-out conclusions", and to do this effectively, we need to have a heightened sense of self-awareness in terms of how our communication will come across and how decisions and conclusions drawn will impact others and their willingness to collaborate. |

Below under each pillar there are a few questions that managers should consider when assessing team member growth potential. Please note that the answer to all of these questions does not have to be `yes` to determine a team member is "exceeding" growth potential, the questions are here to help guide managers through the thought and evaluation process.  

#### Adaptability

1. Does the team member adapt to change well? (I.E. realignments, management changes, company changes, etc.)
1. Does the team member seek to learn new skills to further succeed in their role?
1. Has the team member demonstrated ability to learn new things effectively under pressure?

#### Expandability

1. Does the team member demonstrate interest in other areas outside of the immediate scope of their role?
1. Does the team member invest time in learning new skills that will help them grow (laterally or vertically)?
1. Has the team member volunteered for any "stretch" projects or initiatives? 
1. Does the team member coach, mentor, and/or influence others? 

#### Consistency

1. Does the team member consistently deliver results?
1. Does the team member follow through on their commitments? 
1. Is the team member dependable? 
1. If scope or timeline change, does the team member communicate the change and provide updates to stakeholders? 

#### Self-Awareness

1. Does the team member respond to feedback aligned with our [Receiving Feedback Guidelines](/handbook/people-group/guidance-on-feedback/#receiving-feedback)?
1. Does the team member acknowledge their strengths and areas of improvement?
1. Does the team member work towards closing gaps for their improvement areas? 
1. Does the team member demonstrate sound judgment in their decision-making?

### Growth Potential Output

After assessing team member growth potential based on the four pillars outlined above, managers can determine whether team member growth potential is currently developing, growing, or exceeding. 

#### Developing

"Developing" growth potential generally refers to a team member who is not working at full growth potential against the roles and responsibilities outlined in their Job Family. There could be a variety of reasons for this, including:

* They are new to their role and did not have the time to demonstrate willingness and/or ability aligned with the pillars of growth potential
* Lack of motivation to take on new projects
* Motivated to do what is needed in current job, not in what is required in a higher level
* Not expressing interest or demonstrating desire to continuously learn new skills


Please note that "developing" growth potential *does not* equate to "developing" performance, but correlates with the pillars of growth potential outlined in the "measuring growth potential" section below. 

Examples:
- A team member is recently promoted or is new to the company, and hasn't had sufficient time to demonstrate the pillars of growth potential for a sustained period of time (and at the new level, if recently promoted) 
- A team member has actively expressed that they do not have an interest in learning new skills or take on new projects. In a day-to-day they show self-awareness but they have not shown great adaptability, expandability and consistency to further expand on their role and responsibilities. 

#### Growing

"Growing" growth potential generally refers to a team member who is growing in their current role and demonstrating interest in advancing (up or laterally) and they exhibit knowledge, skills, and abilities that indicate this. Team members with "growing" growth potential generally:

* Show interest in areas outside of their immediate scope occasionally
* Are comfortable in their current role
* Are a stable counterpart for other team members (especially for peers and more junior team members)
* Learn and apply new skills when the job calls for it; apply lessons learned to enhance success

Example: 
- A team member has demonstrated adaptability and expandability but has not been consistent in their results or self-awareness. This holds the team member back from growing to a higher level or taking on more complex responsibilities in their current role. 

#### Exceeding

"Exceeding" growth potential generally indicates that a team member will be ready for promotion within the next year (or when an opportunity arises). "Exceeding" growth potential team members:

* Frequently seek involvement in stretch project/projects outside of their scope
* Invest in their development; seek feedback to improve and applies that feedback on the job
* Demonstrate ability to learn new skills
* Actively pursue increased opportunities to influence decisions and inspire others

Example: 
- A team member has consistently and proactively looked for opportunities to fill gaps and take on stretch projects. When another team member left the team, you leaned on this team member to help keep projects moving forward until you found a suitable backfill. They regularly ask for feedback from peers and adapt their approach accordingly. This has given your team member skills beyond their current job requirements, and broader understanding of the business.


## Calibration 

The portion of the Performance/Growth Potential matrix that often entails the most significant time commitment is the live calibration session of team members with leadership. The calibration session is very valuable to ensure consistency across the Job Family and level, raise any questions, and provide cross-departmental and/or cross-divisional feedback on team members to capture the assessment of different managers as opposed to the opinion of the direct manager exclusively. 

- Ensure consistency and fairness in assessments 
- Calibrate on approach and thought process behind assessments
- Provide cross-departmental and/or cross-divisional feedback
- Provide an additional checkpoint to check for [unconscious bias](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/)

Calibration can be done asynchronously or synchronously, and should be done by level (I.E. Manager calibration for their directs, Director calibration for their directs, etc.) so as not to disclose Talent Assessment evaluations amongst peers.


### Calibration Session

The calibration session is one of the most important pieces of the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix process, as it provides time for managers, their peers, and their manager to calibrate. Below are a few communication guidelines to ensure efficiency and fairness during the calibration session discussion. 

#### Best Practices

* Be conscious of time and consider setting a (reasonable) time limit per team member being discussed. 
* Review program guidelines and avoid leniency bias.
* Refer to performance data that you may have taken on a team member throughout the past year - including 360 review feedback (if both team member and manager agree to include), performance against metrics over time, key accomplishments, etc.; this will help avoid bias like recency bias or the halo effect. Please note that when reviewing 360 data for the Q4 talent assessment, it's important to take into account areas in which the team member has improved. Two quarters is a fairly significant amount of time and team members have (hopefully) take action on improvement areas during this period, which should be reflected in the assessment. Managers and other participants in calibration discussions should be prepared with this information if asked how they determined a rating. 
* Leaders should feel comfortable highlighting team members in other functions
* Focus on discussing artifacts that are relevant to the performance factor and refrain from discussing artifacts that are not relevant to performance being developing, performing or exceeding. Examples of artifacts which are not relevant: upcoming maternity/parental leave, personal information/home situation or things that were confidentially shared and do not relate to performance. 
* Refer to the competencies and values when deciding what is relevant.
* Focus on facts and avoid blanket statements (I.E. [team member] has poor communication)
* Calibration is not a stack ranking of team members. While some inter-person comparison may happen, it should only be to ensure that evaluations are being applied fairly across different raters.
* **Ask questions and provide feedback!** This may seem obvious, but it is import aspect to help identify any potential bias

##### Who Do I Calibrate?

It is likely not necessary to discuss each team member in detail, particularly for larger groups. Calibration sessions typically focuses on gaps, outliers and areas that might require additional management attention and/or alignment. 

As a best practice, we should calibrate outliers. "Outliers" are typically considered to [Box 1 ("Exceeding Growth Potential" and "Exceeding Performance") and Box 9 ("Developing Growth Potential" and "Developing Performance")](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/). [People Business Partners](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) and business leaders have discretion to expand this threshold as needed, but live calibration for team members in Box 1 and Box 9 should be the baseline across the board. 

A few additional reasons to consider calibrating beyond Box 1 and Box 9 are:

- Team members close to promotion
- Team members who have changed assessments from the previous fiscal year (I.E. "Performing Performance" to "Exceeding Performance")
- Team members in Box 3 ("Exceeding Growth Potential" and "Performing Performance") to highlight potential development opportunities from peer groups
- Outliers based on Performance alone (I.E. everyone "Developing Performance" and everyone "Exceeding performance")
- Anyone hired in the last 3 months assessed as Performing or Exceeding for Performance aligned with eligibility guidance
- Anyone identified as Key Talent


#### Calibration Session Pre-Work

It is **absolutely essential** that managers complete the required pre-work to ensure that the live calibration session is as efficient and productive as possible. Pre work includes:

- For calibration sessions you can leverage [this agenda template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrlZSfdNXpSZ09uvDM71KxH42RWBJxa6U1QTCTw05iI/edit)
- Review the team member's own [Self-Evaluation](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#team-member-self-evaluations), if they wished to complete one.
- Review the Job Family/Families that will be reviewed in detail
- Review our competencies 
    - [Talent Assessment Training](https://levelup.gitlab.com/access/saml/login/internal-team-members?returnTo=https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/course/talent-assessment)
    - [Values competencies](/handbook/competencies/#values-competencies)
    - [Remote work competencies](/handbook/competencies/#remote-work-competencies)
    - [Functional competencies](/handbook/competencies/#functional-competencies) _(if applicable)_
    - [Job framework](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#job-frameworks)
- Review our [Unconscious Bias](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/) handbook page and consider watching our [Recognizing Bias Training](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/unconscious-bias/#recognizing-bias-training) if you haven't already. 
- Review the [Performance/Growth Potential Matrix Training Information](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/151ys8xkOak9ifU9IPXQydZ44sb_BoMpMocWmjVonLHE/edit), which delves into definitions for each box. 
- Determine the appropriate box for each of your team members
- Add notes for each of your team members to the agenda, at least 12 hours before the session 
    - An example of notes could include:
        - 2-3 strengths/accomplishments (and supporting examples)
        - 2-3 improvement areas
        - Anything else noteworthy (I.E. recently promoted, COVID impact, etc.)
- Keep the [SBI Model](/handbook/people-group/guidance-on-feedback/#s-b-i-model) (Situation, Behavior, Impact) in mind when adding notes for strengths/accomplishments and improvement areas. Each point should include clear examples and blanket statements should be avoided. 
- Review the notes of your peers for other team members and add feedback/questions/thoughts for discussion
- If you did not attend the people manager live training session, please watch the training video below:

#### Topics To Avoid

While we want to encourage open and transparent conversation during calibration session, there are certain topics that should be avoided to ensure we respect team member privacy.

* Sharing whether team members are currently undergoing [formal performance remediation](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/#options-for-remediation). It is okay to share that team members are receiving coaching, but specifics pertaining to Written coaching, PIPs, etc. should be avoided. 
* Anything related to health (I.E. medical diagnoses, conditions, disabilities, etc.). It is okay to share that team members have a lot going on in their personal lives, but we should not go into detail. _Note that this applies for team member's friends/family as well._

## Identifying Action 

After the calibration sessions the performance and growth potential outcomes can be used as input for the following: 
* [Career Development Conversations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/#career-development-discussion-at-the-1-1)
* Promotion planning 
* Identifying [L&D opportunities](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/)
* Succession Planning


# Q4 Formal Talent Assessment 

## Timeline
Below is the high level timeline for the formal assessment in Q4 FY23 (Nov, Dec, Jan). Different departments may have additional due dates built into the high level timeline, so please follow up with your [People Business Partner](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) if you have any questions. 

- **2022-10-03:**Training and Enablement
- **2022-10-19:** Kick off Optional Self-Evaluation cycle for all Team Members and Required Manager Evaluation in Workday
- **2022-11-04:** Due date for all Manager Evaluations to be complete
- **2022-11-04:** 5:00pm PST Talent Assessment locked
- **2022-11-07 - 2022-11-29:** Time for calibration and finalising assessments
- **2022-11-30:** 5:00pm PST Workday Calibration will be locked 
- **2022-12-01 - 2022-12-08:** Total Rewards and E-Group review and approval
- **2022-12-09 - 2022-12-22 (5:00pm PST):** Managers will have access to Workday Talent Assessment to finalize evaluations
- **2023-01-03 - 2023-01-31:** Managers can communicate Performance/Growth Potential assessment to team members
- **2023-01-05:** Annual Compensation Review Kicks off for Managers

### Cadence

Our e-group completes Performance/Growth Potential Matrix multiple times a year for their direct reports. The rest of GitLab does this _at least_ once per year in Q4, with a recommended informal mid-year check-in. The formal assessment would ideally take place in November prior to the [annual compensation review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#annual-compensation-review). 

### Eligibility

Anyone hired on or before October 31st should receive a Performance and Growth Potential assessment. However, if the team member being assessed has been with GitLab for a period of 3 months or less:

- It is likely that these team members will fall into `Developing` for performance and should not expect a compensation adjustment, although they are still eligible to be reviewed. This is because team members generally need several months to get adjusted to their role and responsibilities, and we aim to hire team members at their accurate market rate. 
-  Team member manager do not need to complete the full self-assessment or manager evaluation form if they have been employed less than 3 months, but a rating should be allocated.

While there are exceptions, this is the general guideline. 

### Team Member Self-Evaluations

It is up to all team members' discretion if they wish to complete their Self-Evaluation in Workday. This self-evaluation will be shared with their manager prior to the manager's evaluation and Calibration Sessions. Please review the most current [timeline](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#timeline) to ensure a timely delivery.

### Matrix Assessment Timeline 

The Performance/Growth Potential Matrix typically takes 4-6 weeks to complete from beginning to end. Steps are as follows:

1. Team members have the opportunity to complete a Performance Review Self-Evaluation if they so wish, and share it with their manager through Workday.
1. Managers complete a Manager evaluation and Performance/Growth Potential ratings for their respective team members
1. Live session takes place for calibration with managers up to E-Group level
1. Executive Review (leadership meets to review the matrix results, key talent, promotion requests, development and performance actions, review discrepancies, and measure against previous matrix results)
1. Total Rewards performs an equality review. 
1. Final approval of E-Group member and Total Rewards. 
1. Performance and Growth Potential results are communicated to team members. 
1. Annual Compensation review kicks off after Talent Assessment


## Communication 

In most companies the Performance/Growth Potential Matrix is used exclusively as a management tool and results are not typically shared with team members. In the spirit of our transparency value, we want to encourage feedback with team members. **Discussion topics that arise during calibration sessions (or at any other point during the assessment process) are confidential. Please do not share with anyone other than each individual team member.**

The guidelines below are general guidelines and recommendations. However, *each department is at liberty to determine what works best for their groups in collaboration with their People Business Partner*. For all groups we recommend that managers communicate Performance and Growth Potential assessments. 

### Final Assessments in Workday

Aligned with the [timeline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#timeline), managers can see final assessments for each of their team members in their respective Workday profiles. 


## Promotions During Assessment Cycle

The cut-off date to determine whether to assess team members at the pre-promotion level or post-promotion level for the Q4 FY23 Talent Assessment cycle is **October 31, 2022**. Guidelines are as follows: 

1. **If a team member is promoted with an effective date _on or before_ October 31, 2022, they should be assessed at the newly promoted level.** 
    * For example, if a Product Manager is promoted to Senior Product Manager with an effective date of October 15, 2022 in Workday (our SSOT for promotion effective dates), they will be assessed at the Senior Product Manager level for the Q4 Talent Assessment.  
1. **If a team member is promoted with an effective date _on or after_ November 1, 2022, they should be assessed at the pre-promotion level.**
    * For example, if a Backend Engineer is promoted to Senior Backend Engineer with an effective date of November 1, 2022, their pre-promotion assessment at the intermediate Backend Engineer level will remain.

It is important to note that because being promoted recognizes high performance both in terms of increased scope/responsibility and monetarily through compensation increase therefore a **promotion "resets" the performance factor evaluation**. 

## Transfers During The Assessment Period

Many team members take advantage of internal mobility opportunities we have at GitLab and change role, departments, and sometimes even divisions during the course of the year. 

When assessing team members who have switched teams or changed roles throughout the year, managers should:

- Ensure they gather feedback from the previous manager on performance as well
- Ensure the official Talent Assessment rating reflects the _full year_ performance and growth potential assessment (previous role and current role) and provide holistic feedback reflective of both positions 
- Provide team member feedback on how they're doing in their current role to ensure they're set up for success, and aware of feedback moving forward in their current position 

## Best Practices for Communicating Performance/Growth Potential Factors

After calibration sessions are done and performance and growth potential factors are determined, it’s time to communicate the final results with team members (after you have been notified that they have been approved by the E-Group). **Please refrain from communicating Performance factors until approval through the E-group level is communicated.** Having an extensive conversation on performance and growth potential with your team members is a great way to set them up for success going forward. We also want to take the opportunity to give them a perspective on their career development. Below we will take you through some of the best practices, but remember, if you are even in doubt please reach out to your manager or [People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division) for support. 

1. **Communicate performance and growth potential factors face-to-face over Zoom**. As a manager, this is the opportunity for you to have a conversation with your team member about their performance and growth potential. Having the conversation over Zoom allows for you to have a dialogue with your team member (versus just sharing their performance and growth potential factor) and allows you to pick up other information, like tone and non-verbal cues which can tell you more about how someone is feeling during this conversation.

1. **Prepare for the discussion ahead of time.** As a manager, you should have prepared in advance of calibration discussions with your team members. Before communicating a team member’s [performance and growth potential factors](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#performance-factor), it’s beneficial to look back through your preparation document, notes, and anything relevant that was discussed as part of the calibration exercise. Be prepared with notes on the following: 
    * Areas the team member is doing well
    * Areas that need improvement
    * Provide specific examples for both strengths and improvement areas. The [SBI](/handbook/people-group/guidance-on-feedback/#s-b-i-model) (Situation - Behavior - Impact) model can be effective for delivering examples structured in a way that makes impact clear to team members. 
    * Think about recommendations and/or focus areas for a team member’s development


1. **Schedule a separate call or repurpose your [1:1](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/) to discuss a team member’s performance and growth potential factor**. The performance and growth potential factors should be communicated at the beginning of the meeting. This allows the team member time to ask questions, discuss their assessment, and most importantly, determine next steps.

1. **Protect the confidentiality of other team members** by avoiding saying things like “you were the only team member to be rated this performance factor.”

1. **Avoid making future promises** like, “In the next review, I will rate you X performance/growth potential factor.”

### Manager Scenarios - Performance & Growth Potential

**My team member is on a leave (protected leave or PTO) during the Talent Assessment period. How should I handle communication of their assessment?**

If they will be returning from leave before the due date to communicate [Talent Assessment results](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#timeline), please wait until their return from leave to communicate their assessment. If they are returning from leave after the due date to communicate Talent Assessment results, you may email them to offer to discuss their assessment. If they do not reply or prefer to wait until their return, please respect that choice.

**My team member was on protected leave for a large portion of the Talent Assessment period. How should I factor this in when assessing them?**

It’s important to ensure you are assessing the team member's performance for their contributions while working during the assessment time period. There should be no adverse impact on their overall assessment due to being on leave for a portion of the period. During calibration, please remain vigilant to ensure no private details related to their time away are disclosed. Please reach out to your PBP to discuss the specific details related to your team member. 

**My team member was assessed as key talent last year, and is not for this assessment period. How should I handle communication with them?**

There is no guarantee that team members will retain their key talent assessment each assessment period. Make sure to explain the reasons why their key talent assessment has changed, including how we assess Key Talent and the [definition outlined in the Handbook](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent).
Remember to end the conversation by discussing what your expectations are of key talent going forward. It’s important not to make promises about future assessments, but to focus on what makes a team member critical to the business, and how you, their manager, will support them.

**My team member was exceeding performance last assessment, and is not for this period. How should I communicate this change?**

It’s important to take a look at what may have changed since last year. Is your team member in a new role? On a new team? Did they take on bigger stretch assignments? 
Any of these factors can influence a team member’s performance. Be prepared with specific examples to share which support your performance assessment. The feedback conversation should also focus on what success looks like for the team member in the year to come and how you, as the manager, can support them with their goals. 

**I have just adopted a new team, and the previous manager is no longer at GitLab. How can I assess the performance of my team fairly?** 

You may be able to gather insights from your manager or cross functional stakeholders who have worked closely with the team member in the performance period. You may have access to the recent 360 feedback for each of your team members, as well as their talent assessment from last year to help inform your thinking. If you haven’t already, it’s important to ask the team member to share their own perspective on their accomplishments prior to you taking the role, so you are well prepared for the discussion of your assessment. 

**My team member does not agree with their placement in performance and growth potential. How should I approach this?** 

Remember that this conversation will be most effective if you are well prepared. If you haven’t yet, take an opportunity before the performance and growth potential conversation to understand their own assessment of their results.
During the performance and growth potential conversation, provide the opportunity for a dialogue with your team member. Remain open and curious about their perspective. Engage in active listening, ensuring that you aren’t planning your counterpoints while they are sharing. The expectation is not that the results will necessarily change but the insights they provide may shape how you both think about their growth and development path. 
If you feel a conversation might be particularly challenging, you may reach out to the TMR team or your PBP to role play the discussion and ensure you are prepared.

**My team member is exceeding growth potential expectations, how should I be thinking about their ongoing development?** 

Great! At GitLab team members have the opportunity to own their own development, and deserve a great manager (you) to facilitate it. Ask your team member to articulate where they would like to see their skills and career develop. You may have insights that help them refine those goals based on where you see the business going, as they will be most successful in gaining the experience they’re looking for if there are opportunities to align those goals with business goals. 
Using the [70-20-10 model for learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#70-20-10-rule-for-development), help your team member identify experiential and formal learning opportunities, and consider connections you can facilitate that will support their growth.
The [Career Development handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) has more ideas to help your team member craft a growth plan, including information on GitLab’s [Growth and Development benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/growth-and-development/).

**How should we be communicating Growth Potential to team members who we haven't communicated this to before?**

First, ensure the team member understands what we mean when we say we are assessing Growth Potential, including the [4 pillars](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth) that you considered when making the assessment. Be prepared with specifics that led to your evaluation.
Remember, Growth Potential can change over time as team members are promoted, develop new interests, as new opportunities for growth arise, and as team members continue to broaden their knowledge, skills, and abilities. Avoid making promises, but if your team member sees themselves in a higher position, help them understand behaviors you expect to be able to assess them differently next time.

**I received unexpected feedback about my team member from a cross-functional stakeholder in my calibration session. What should I do?**

If you receive unexpected feedback during the calibration, ensure you really understand what happened, and what has been discussed with your team member so far. If someone has tried to help this team member in the past, how did it go? Can your peer provide specifics to help you understand the impact of the behaviors? Talk to your peer about the importance of using this feedback to help your team member grow, and make sure you have agreement on how you plan to deliver this message. 
During the discussion with your team member, be prepared to gain their perspective on the situation first. Listen actively and consider their point of view. When delivering the message, consider the root cause, focus on impact and alignment with our values, and end with a discussion on future actions that would be more successful. 
If and when appropriate, check in with your peer on how improvements are going. Be sure to stay close to the situation so you are in a position to deliver more timely feedback if the behavior is ongoing. 

**How do I assess team members in acting or interim roles?**

For team members who have assumed an [Acting or an Interim role](/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#interim-and-acting-roles), we will assess team members aligned with their *permanent positions* (I.E. not the Acting or Interim position). 
As the Talent Assessment impacts compensation, and Acting/Interim periods are not permanent, in the instance that a team member does not end up moving into the Acting/Interim role permanently, we would not want to have their compensation impacted by a temporary position.

**My team member is performing at a high level in terms of results, but they struggle with behavioral alignment to one or more of our values. How do I take the “how” into account when I am assessing their performance and growth?** 

Review the handbook content on how we [measure Performance](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#measuring-performance) and how we [measure Growth Potential](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#measuring-growth). When a high output/results-oriented team member is struggling with soft skills and/or behavior, this is oftentimes related to improvement areas in terms of alignment to our [values competencies](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#gitlab-competencies), and/or our [Growth Potential pillars](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#measuring-growth) (particularly, but not limited to, Self-Awareness). Considering our measurement guidelines for Performance and Growth Potential holistically, and be sure that your assessment takes all of our competencies, job family responsibilities, and pillars into account. 

**My team member has the skills to perform, but there are [will-based performance issues](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/#will-based-performance) that are impacting their ability or the team’s ability to succeed. How should I think about this in terms of assessing their performance?**

First, act early. Do not wait for a formal performance and growth potential assessment conversation to deliver feedback about your concerns. Be specific, and document your conversation. Loop in a TMR specialist for support as these conversations can be challenging. 
Review the definition of “Developing” performance. Note that one criteria that applies to this category is a team member who is struggling to perform in a way that is aligned to our values and competencies. Think about the specific behaviors or impacts of their work or how they are working that have led you to assess that they are not fully engaged. Despite having the skills, if your team member is not contributing at the level they are expected to be, you should consider that a performance issue in the way you would a skill based performance issue. Keep in mind that not addressing these challenges may be affecting your other team members, especially those who may be picking up the slack. We encourage to review the handbook page on [Underperformance](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/#talent-assessment-and-managing-underperformance).

### Sample Script for Delivering a Talent Assessment

The script below is intended to help you structure your Performance and Growth Potential conversation. Personalizing this conversation to reflect your authentic tone will make this a more effective conversation with your team member. 
 
"Thank you for taking some time today to discuss your Performance and Growth Potential. I wanted to discuss your achievements and strengths, improvement areas, future development, and the final result of the talent assessment." 

"I assessed your performance factor as ****[Insert Performance factor]***:"
* ***Exceeding*** (consistently surpassing the demands of their current position)
* ***Performing*** (“on track” and meeting all expectations of current position)
* ***Developing*** (room to learn and grow, not currently meeting all expectations of current position)

"I assessed your performance as ***[Insert Performance Factor]*** because:"
*  I assessed your performance against your job responsibilities as ***[Insert Performance Factor]***.
    * Your strengths in your job responsibilities are [Insert strengths with supporting examples]
    * Your opportunities in your job responsibilities are [Insert opportunities with supporting examples]

* I assessed your performance against values and remote working (add management/leadership competencies if applicable) competencies as ***[Insert Performance Factor]***.
    * Your strengths in aligned competencies are [Insert strengths with supporting examples]
    * Your opportunities in aligned competencies are [Insert opportunities with supporting examples]

"I assessed your growth potential factor as ****[Insert Growth potential factor]***:"
* ***Exceeding*** (ready to take on more responsibilities within the next year (or when an opportunity arises))
* ***Growing*** (growing in current role, demonstrating interest in advancing (up or laterally) and they exhibit knowledge, skills, and abilities that indicate this.)
* ***Developing*** (not working at full growth potential against the roles and responsibilities)

"I assessed your growth potential as ***[Insert Growth Potential Factor]*** because:"
*  I assessed your growth potential against the four pillars of growth potential as ***[Insert Growth Potential Factor]***.
    * You have shown X, Y, Z [Insert strengths with supporting examples]
    * Your opportunities to further grow in your role are X, Y, Z are [Insert opportunities with supporting examples]

I'd like to thank you for your hard work, and I look forward to continuing to work together! Do you you have any questions? ***[Allow team member to ask questions and respond]*** 
As a next step, let's schedule some time to talk more about what you want to do in the future and create a career development plan together. 

### Sample Next Steps
The most important part of the performance factor discussion is to determine next steps in partnership with your team member. The team member should be the DRI for the next steps with support from you as their manager. 
Our [Career Development handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) includes a lot of great information and resources on career development including [an individual growth plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjdIuK5mNpljiHnFMK4dvqfTOzV9iSJj66OtoYbniFM/edit) and [career development worksheet](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#internal-resources-1) which should help provide structure and a plan for next steps. 
If you have any questions or concerns about next steps, please contact your manager and/or your [People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division). 

## FAQs 

### Performance/Growth Potential Review General FAQs

* **Why does this matter to me?** <br> 
The Talent Assessment involves all team members and managers. 
    * Team Members are assessed according to [performance](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-performance) and [growth potential](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth). Team Members should be prepared to have a conversation with their manager about their performance and growth potential in **December/January** each year. <br>
    * Managers assess their team members' [performance](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-performance) and [growth potential](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth). Managers attend calibration meetings in which team members' ratings are discussed and evaluated to ensure consistency and minimize bias. Once the program closes, managers are responsible for communicating Performance/Growth Potential Factor to team members.<br>

* **How does this impact the way I work at GitLab?** 
    * [The Performance Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-performance) is an evaluation of your performance against [job family responsibilities](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#job-family-responsibilities-and-functional-competencies) and [GitLab competencies](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#gitlab-competencies) and [Growth](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth) is evaluated against the 4 pillars of Growth Potential. Both can help you determine strengths and improvement areas that you can apply in your day to day work/way you work.<br>

* **How does this impact the teams I lead?** 
    * As a manager, you assess your team members' [performance](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-performance) and [growth potential](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#what-is-growth). Managers attend calibration meetings in which team members' assessments are discussed and evaluated to ensure consistency and minimise bias. Once the program closes, managers are responsible for communicating Performance/Growth Potential Factor to team members.<br>

* **Who I can reach out to in supporting me during Talent Assessments for my team?**  
    * You can reach out to your manager or your [aligned People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division). <br>

* **As a manager, when reviewing my team members, what is the difference between Developing and Underperformance?**
    * The "Developing" rating means that the team member is not (yet) meeting all of the responsibilities and competencies for the role. This can be for many reasons, including a recent start date. By contrast, [Underperformance](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/) involves *consistently* not meeting the goals and requirements of the job; GitLab follows specific processes to attempt to remediate. 
    * While everyone within the Developing category isn't automatically Underperforming, a team member who is Underperforming would also be grouped into the Developing category, because Performing is not an accurate assessment. 
    * Team members who are on a formal Underperformance remediation plan, such as a [Performance Improvement Plan](/handbook/leadership/underperformance/#performance-improvement-plan-pip), are not eligible for a compensation increase as a result of the [Annual Compensation Review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/).

* **How should I factor in COVID impact when assessing performance and growth potential?** 
    When assessing team members affected by COVID (reduced schedules, modified working hours, more extended time off, mental health impact, etc.), please keep in mind:

    -  Team members should be assessed at the _agreed upon and expected level_. For example, if manager and team member have agreed that the team member will be working at 80% for a period of time, the team member's performance should be assessed at 80% during that period (not at 100%).  
    - We should be looking _holistically_ at performance and growth potential. This performance review should assess the team member's last 12 months of tenure (or less if the team member has joined more recently). Please ensure you are mindful of [recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias), particularly for those team members who have struggled with COVID impact. 

    Team members: It is very important that you are transparent with your manager if you are experiencing significant impact from COVID that has affected your overall performance. Managers cannot be mindful of the points above during assessment periods if they are not aware and expectations are not aligned. If it is helpful, feel free to use the [COVID Self-Evaluation template](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/covid-19/#self-evaluation) to facilitate a discussion with your manager.

* **Will my Growth Potential assessment impact my compensation?** 
    Yes in FY22 both Performance, Growth Potential, and Key Talent Assessment can impact your Total Rewards. 

    If you have any questions, please reach out to your aligned [People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division). 

* **How is this different from what we did in the past?** <br>
    * **Talent Assessment Process:** Prior to FY21, GitLab did not have a unified company-wide talent assessment process. Some groups leveraged a 9-box format or skill/will matrices, but there was no formal program to support the review of team members. With the Performance/Growth process, talent-review cycles take place company-wide twice each year, using the same assessment template. <br>
    * **Changes to the Annual Compensation Review Program:** Prior to FY21, in preparation for the Annual compensation review, managers went through a process to assess team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities, summarized as their *compa group*. This was an input to the compensation review program, in addition to location factor changes, and cost of living adjustments. Starting FY21, the compa group assessment has been replaced with the Performance/Growth Potential factor. Location factor changes will continue to be incorporated into the program. As of XXX date, we have removed cost-of-living adjustments. <br>

### Performance/Growth Potential Communication FAQs
* **Can my performance factor be changed?**
    * After the Talent Assessment closes, the performance factor cannot be changed. You should work with your manager to develop a plan to develop your performance for future assessments.
* **Does this mean I am automatically getting an X% increase in the upcoming Annual Compensation Review?**
The Performance/Growth Potential Factor is one of the factors considered in the [Annual Compensation review](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-review-cycle/#annual-compensation-review). The recommended increases displayed in the handbook are there to ensure company wide consistency. The factors taken into account for the Annual Compensation Review are: 
    *   Your hire date (new hires hired after October 31st are ineligible for compensation review)
    *   Other compensation increases received over the last year
    *   Timing of promotion and/or role changes
    *   Your current placement within the compensation band
    *   Location factor 
    *   Role benchmark updates 
    *   Company budget for compensation increases
* **When is the next opportunity for my performance to be reviewed?**
    * Talent Assessments are performed twice per year -- one mid-year (Q2) and one at the end of fiscal year (Q4). 
* **What can I do to change my performance factor in the future?**
    * There are many things that you can do to change your performance factor in the future. Please work with your manager on a career development plan and discuss actions that can be taken to improve. 
* **Can my Growth Potential rating be changed?**
    * After the Talent Assessment closes, your growth potential factor cannot be changed. Your manager assessed your growth potential factor and this would be an opportunity for you and your manager to align on your growth opportunities. This discussion can also be an input into your career development discussion. 
* **What can I do to change my Growth Potential rating in the future?**
    * There are many things that a team member can do to change their growth potential factor in the future. Talk with your manager about how you might be able to develop a plan to increase your [expandability, adaptability, consistency and self-awareness](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#measuring-growth). Do you currently possess all the skills needed for your current role? Have you identified what skills you would like to learn? Have you determined what your career goals are, and are you actively working towards those goals? Are there additional projects to take on, to stretch your current responsibilities and/or skills? These are some discussion questions that might help you and your manager align on a future plan for growth. 
* **My team member is currently on a performance remediation plan; how should I handle this?**
    *  You should continue to move forward with communicating their performance factor to them and use the meeting as an opportunity to reinforce the expectations of meeting the goals highlighted in the plan.
* **My team member has recently been promoted - but we assessed the Performance/Growth Potential prior to the promotion. How do I communicate that to the team member?**
    *  The timing of a promotion can sometimes coincide with the Talent Assessment. It's important to discuss with the team member whether the talent assessment was based on the previous or new role. Being promoted recognizes high performance both in terms of increased scope/responsibility, and monetarily through compensation increase; therefore a **promotion "resets" the performance/growth potential factor evaluation** if the team member was assessed prior to the promotion. With the promotion, the job responsibilities and scope can change significantly; therefore a new assessment should be made at the next talent assessment period. We recommend you review the responsibilities of the new role and identify focus points for growth in the new role. 

## Mid-Year Check In

Great managers share [feedback](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/guidance-on-feedback/) with team members year-round in 1:1 meetings and ad-hoc. A dedicated Mid-Year check-in is a useful tool to support a  holistic discussion between team member and manager about how things are going as we approach the second half of the fiscal year. During the Mid-Year check in, we assess how things are going from both the team member and managers' points of view, and share feedback to help inform performance and development plans. Leaning into where things are going well, as well as uncovering blind spots or improvement areas early are the keys to delivering great results. A Mid-Year check in complements weekly, on-going feedback, so we recommend documenting your discussion in your 1:1 doc to support frequent updates on action items and development goals.  

Goals of the Mid-Year check in are:

* To provide a dedicated space for questions/clarification about performance and growth opportunities at GitLab
* Team members share a cumulative self assessment of their performance against expectations and progress on development goals   
* Managers respond, and provide their own cumulative update to the team member on how things are going. This should build on the regular performance feedback they should be delivering weekly in 1:1s and ensure no surprises at the end of the year review.

#### Eligibility

To participate in the mid-year check in we recommend that team members have at least 3 months of tenure so accomplishments and improvement areas are able to be clearly outlined with examples. As our mid-year review kicks off on 2022-06-08, team members who started _on or before 2022-03-08 would be eligible to participate_. 

#### Process 

Recommended process for our FY'23 Q2 cycle will be as follows:

1. _Team Member Led: Team member provides a self-assessment on their own performance in their [1:1 document](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/)_

Team members can leverage their 1:1 document and should reflect on their achievements, strengths, and opportunity areas since the last formal Talent Assessment in FY'22 Q4. It is the team member’s responsibility to provide the self-assessment and bring it to the conversation with their manager to discuss and align. Documenting in the 1:1 agenda ensures the material is available to come back to throughout the rest of the year.  

A recommended agenda for the Mid-Year check-in 1:1 is as follows:

- **Achievements**

List your 3 most significant achievements since the last formal [Talent Assessment](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/), aligned with the job responsibilities and expectations of the role. This can include significant impact to the department or company, customer-impact, community-impacting, etc. Feedback can also be included in this section if applicable.

- **Strengths & Opportunities in Role**

In this area the goal is to determine 2-3 strengths and 2-3 opportunity areas in accordance with your role, job family, and [job framework](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#job-frameworks). Include examples when necessary to provide clarity or context.  Ensure there are actionable takeaways.

- **Support Needed**

A place to outline any support needed from your manager for your ongoing success and development at GitLab.

- **Manager Feedback**

Managers will provide additional feedback or response to the self-assessment outlined above. Managers should be sure to reference the Achievements (3) and Roles & Responsibilities (Strengths and Opportunities) outlined by the team member above, and to any additional thoughts or feedback (2-3 points).

- **Next Steps**

A space for the team member and manager to document any relevant next steps stemming from this conversation. This could be a full [Individual Growth Plan](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#individual-growth-plan) or a couple of key actions or development opportunities for the individual. 

2. _Manager Feedback: Team members let their manager know when they have provided their self-assessment overview in their [1:1 document](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/1-1/)_

Team members should share their Mid-Year Check In document with their manager at least one week prior to the live discussion to ensure managers have time to review the content, and to add in their own feedback in the `Manager Feedback` section.

3. _Live Discussion_

Team members and managers use a dedicated 1:1 to discuss the Mid Year check in.

4. _Align on actions/next steps_

Team member and manager align on action items stemming from the conversation to best support team member development and alignment to their goals. You are encourage to leverage our [Career Development and Mobility](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) handbook page for ideas and inspiration. 

#### Timeline

Mid-Year Check In launch: 
- 2022-06-08

Mid-Year Check In end:
- 2022-07-22

We have intentionally provided a longer timeline to ensure different business group priorities are accommodated. 


 
## Succession Planning

Succession planning is an important step in our Talent Assessment process. Completing the [Performance/Growth Potential Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) gives leaders a fresh overview of the top performers and the highest growth team members in their respective organizations. Particularly for individuals in Senior Leadership roles and above (the [S-Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#s-group) and depending on structure the [Director-Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/#director-group)), a recommended next step following the Performance/Growth Potential assessment is to do succession planning. 

Succession planning ensures we are identifying and developing future GitLab leaders to ensure business continuity in the event of an unforeseen change, and providing the current leadership team the opportunity to grow and scale. It may provide an opportunity to diversify our leadership team by developing our internal bench of talent. Note, potential alone does not determine who will be a successor. Strong succession candidates should demonstrate sustained exceeding performance and growth, aspire to have a role at the next level, and be ready for a much larger role in the near term. 

Questions we should ask ourselves when thinking about succession planning (and the individual(s) identified) are:

1. What are our current and upcoming business goals?
2. Does the successor candidate have a track record of delivering strategic results, working in alignment with our values, and demonstrating high growth potential?
3. Does our successor candidate have skill gaps that must close before they are ready to deliver on the business goals identified? 
4. _(if we do have skill gaps)_ Can we develop our successors to close those gaps? If so, how? How long will this additional exposure and skill development take? Who else at GitLab should we engage to support their development?
5. If not, do we need to hire externally to ensure business continuity? 
6. If we do not have anyone who could assume the role in an emergency situation, what is our plan to provide emergency coverage? 


### Succession Planning Process

The succession planning process might vary slightly for different areas of the business depending on size and structure, but at a high level the process should flow as follows:

1. **Leaders go through the [Performance/Growth Potential Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#the-performancepotential-matrix) process for all of their direct reports.** Ideally, this process includes [calibration](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#calibration-session-guidelines) to generate a level of initial familiarity amongst leadership peers with the talent in the organization. 
2. **Leaders identify and document their respective successors** (and emergency coverage plans if the identified successor could not currently cover in an emergency situation) leveraging [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w-ODnm-S_sV7TAEDqfU6kUpZqr7-cDIFwAlPZI10HzU/edit#slide=id.p). 
3. **Succession plans are reviewed with peers** (I.E. all other executives, all other senior leaders in the function, etc.) and your [People Business Partner](/handbook/people-group/#people-business-partner-alignment-to-division), ideally during a synchronous session to facilitate discussion and questions. 
4. **Development plans are finalized** for successors and documented in the successor slide.
5. _(if applicable)_ **Skills gaps impacting ability to achieve business goals are identified and actions are put in place** to ensure these gaps are closed/minimized (I.E. stretch assignments, increased visibility and exposure, or hiring)

### Succession Readiness Definitions

| Succession Readiness    | Description | 
|-----------|---|
| Emergency (ER) | Someone who could take over this role if the current person were affected by a [lottery factor](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#competitive-rate) or had to take emergency leave. _Note: If there is no one who could assume the role today in an emergency situation, part of the succession coverage plan should include an overview of recommendation steps (I.E. engaging a consultancy, splitting up the team, etc.)_ |   
| Ready Now (RN) | Someone who has 90% of the competency & experience to take the role now |   
| Ready in 1-2 years) | With additional responsibility & exposure, could take the role soon  |   
| Ready in 2-3+ years | Longer term candidate who requires significant development |   
| Interim coverage | Has competency and experience to provide coverage on an interim basis (~6 months), but may not be suitable for the role long-term |

_Note that the `Emergency Coverage` slide in the [template above](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w-ODnm-S_sV7TAEDqfU6kUpZqr7-cDIFwAlPZI10HzU/edit#slide=id.gf99d467451_1_8) should only be used to if the identified successor could not provide temporary coverage for the current leader in an emergency situation._

# Key Talent

## Key Talent Criteria  

Key Talent makes up roughly ~10% of the population. Key Talent represents team members who have a significant impact on GitLab's success. They deliver quality results which are instrumental in moving critical company initiatives forward, and do so consistently in alignment with our values. These team members are often recognized as experts in their current role. Team members, at any level, can be considered Key Talent if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

If the team member were to leave there would be:

- Critical disruption to the product
- Critical disruption to ARR ([Annual Recurring Revenue](/handbook/sales/sales-term-glossary/arr-in-practice/)) - including delays for customers
- Substantially impacts company ability to achieve significant milestones
- Substantial impact to a significant process
- Significant impact to the operation of the functional area

## Key Talent and Performance

Performance and being identified as key talent can influence one another, but they are _not directly related_. For example:

- A team member that has a performance assessment of [“exceeding”](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#exceeding), is not automatically indicated as key talent. Perhaps they are doing exceptionally well in their role, but the impact to the business would not be considered “critical” if they were to leave.
- A team member that is new to the role and still ["developing"](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#developing) could be identified as key talent if they work in an area of the business that is highly specialized and particularly difficult to hire for. 

_Note: Intentionally hoarding knowledge is in direct conflict with our [transparency value](/handbook/values/#transparency) and is viewed as a performance issue as we measure performance based on alignment with our values._

## Process To Determine Key Talent

It is important to have a holistic view of all team members when determining who meets the key talent criteria, which is why we require a certain scope when calibrating key talent and making final recommendations in the organization. There are several factors that can help determine the level at which key talent should be assessed, including things like reporting lines and span of control. As a general rule, if a people manager meets the following requirements, key talent calibrations should start at their level:

- Senior Manager level or above
- 20+ direct and indirect reports

The process to determine Key Talent is as follows: 

   1. Direct managers make initial key talent recommendations in Workday. The direct manager should include the key talent recommendation along with the Performance and Growth Potential recommendation. The [key talent criteria](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent-criteria) that is met should be noted in Workday.
   1. During sub-department calibration sessions, Senior Managers+ should calibrate on the initial key talent recommendations and make adjustments as appropriate, keeping in mind both [key talent criteria](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#key-talent-criteria), and number of individuals identified as key talent, as key talent makes up only ~10% of team members company-wide.
   2. The Senior Manager (if applicable), Director, Senior Directors, VP, and People Business Partner (PBP) discuss and calibrate the Key Talent nominations at the department level calibration sessions.
   5. A final proposal goes to the E-Group member who adds in their Key Talent and reviews for final approval on Division level.

## Organizational Value

A very small portion of our business (roughly ~10% of the population) is considered to be key talent. As such, a team members’ value in the organization should not be determined based on whether or not they are identified as key talent. 

While some team members are identified as key talent, this does not mean the rest of our team is not valued and important to our organization’s success. Aligned with our [expected performance distribution](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#expected-distribution-company-wide), approximately 60-65% of our team are core performers (or ["performing"](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#performing)). Core performers are responsible for keeping things consistently moving forward. This group comprises the largest population in companies across the board for a reason and is an essential part of any organization’s success. 

## Impact of Being Identified as Key Talent 

We want to make sure we use engagement tools to retain Key Talent. A few of our primary engagement tools are: [Learning & Development](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/), growth opportunities and compensation.

* **Learning & Development:** We want to support the growth of Key Talent and their competencies, skills, and knowledge by providing them with the tools they need and the opportunities to progress their own personal and professional development goals. As a people manager it’s your priority to identify [L&D opportunities](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/) for your team. 
* **Growth Opportunities:** As a people manager, it’s important to have career conversations and identify growth opportunities with your team members. For Key Talent, it’s especially important to discuss their motivation and ambitions. Growth opportunities can be both horizontal and vertical. Examples of growth opportunities are: expanding the scope within a team member's current role, a lateral move to a new role, or a promotion to the next level.  
* **Compensation:** At GitLab, compensation = cash + equity + benefits. We have a [market based approach](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/#market-based-approach) and differentiate pay based on performance. Our Annual Compensation Review Cycle and Annual Equity Refresh program allow us to differentiate compensation based on performance and for Key Talent. 
* **Succession Planning:** As team members identified as Key Talent are critical to roles that have a high impact on the company's success, it is important that we identify successors to avoid any single points of failure within the organization.

**Note that being considered or designated as a key talent one year, does not mean or guarantee that a team member will be considered or designated as a key talent moving forward.**
