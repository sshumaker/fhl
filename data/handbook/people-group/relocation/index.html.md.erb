## Relocation / Address Change

This process is managed by the People Connect team as the DRI, in partnership with Total Rewards. For any questions not addressed below, please email [people-connect@gitlab.com](mailto:people-connect@gitlab.com). 

If you are considering a move, it is best to discuss this with your manager as soon as possible, always before you are thinking of moving, to understand the impact on compensation (including review of equity eligibility) or your role at GitLab. Moving to a new location is an exciting adventure to embark upon. However, there are multiple aspects to consider and eligibility to review. 

### Importance of Communicating Location 

Generally, team members may live or work outside their permanent residence for an aggregate amount of 183 days (6 months) per year.  However, the amount does depend on the particular country (or state) and what it considers to be a "resident" for tax purposes, as well as what it considers the tax year.  If you are not sure about the aggregate amount allowed by the country or state where you are visiting, you should check with your personal tax advisor. If you believe you or a team member you manage is at risk of exceeding (or has already exceeded) the aggregate amount of 183 days (6 months) (or less in certain countries), you must contact the People group **immediately**.

If the 6 month timeframe (or other timeframe, as applicable) is at risk of being exceeded or has already been exceeded, please contact the Team Member Relations team at [teammemberrelations@gitlab.com](mailto:teammemberrelations@gitlab.com) 

Team members have the responsibility to ensure their own work eligibility by communicating their location if at risk of exceeding the 6 month timeframe, and managers have a responsibility to their team member and to the business to ensure compliance. 

Having team members for 6 months or more working outside of their contractual location poses potential tax liability for both the business and the team member. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to communicate transparently and promptly with the People Team.

**The consequences of not communicating to the appropriate group, and/or exceeding the `6-month timeframe allotment outside of an individual's country of employment` could result in [underperformance](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/underperformance/) management action or loss of employment, depending on the circumstances.** 


### Considerations and Eligibility 

1. Does GitLab have an [entity](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#gitlab-entities) or use a [PEO(Professional Employment Organisation)](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#peo-professional-employer-organization-employer-of-record-and-not-a-gitlab-entity) where there are no hiring restrictions in the new place you're moving to? We can currently only support relocations to GitLab Entities and PEOs that do not have any hiring restrictions or any headcount cap at this time, this is in alignment with our [Country hiring guidelines](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#country-hiring-guidelines).
1. Would this relocation change your "[Team Member Type](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#team-member-types-at-gitlab)" with GitLab? Are you comfortable with this possible change?
1. Have you considered any changes to [benefits](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/)
1. Do you have the appropriate right to work documentation/visa requirements in the country that you are considering relocating to?
- Please note, at this moment GitLab only sponsors [relocations to the Netherlands](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/visas/#right-to-immigrate-to-the-netherlands) and doesn't cover relocation costs for the team member's family members also looking to relocate.
1. You have been a team member at GitLab for one year (tenure can possibly be waived as a requirement on a case by case basis or if there is violence in your country creating an unsafe environment).


Keep in mind, GitLab retains discretion at all times whether it can accommodate you to continue your role in the new location.  In some instances a move will not align to your proposed location, (e.g. a recruiter hired in EMEA to support EMEA would not be approved to move to the US), and in other instances the company may not be able to support a hire in the proposed location. Second, in almost all situations the compensation, including equity eligibility, may change. For an idea about the compensation impact, please check with our Total Rewards team for an estimate.  The actual compensation amount will be reviewed and will need approval before relocation can occur.

### Short-Term Stay

If you are not changing your permanent location (where you maintain permanent residency), but instead are traveling to different locations over a period of time, you are responsible for maintaining your health insurance, visas, and any other item directly relating to your travel.

Since any short-term stay is your decision and not required by GitLab as part of your role, you will not be eligible to use the [Business Accident Travel Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#business-travel-accident-policy) or submit any expenses related to your travel. If you are hired in a role requiring a time zone alignment, you must still be able to fulfill that requirement.

If your short-term stay is for less than 6 months in a new location, there should be no need to update your address in Workday. 

If you plan on staying in `a location for more than 6 months in a single calendar year, or are in that location for an aggregate of more than 6 months in a single calendar year`, that becomes your residence and you must complete the long-term relocation process described below. In most countries, tax residency is determined by the place where a GitLab Team Member keeps its vital interests over the span of a calendar year. This is the place where you are registered, where your SO and/or dependents live, the place where you work, where you live, where you keep your subscriptions etc.

** Please note that in some jurisdictions, even short term stays can add up to more than 183 days per year and can subject you to payroll tax in the new location.  Anything that does not look like a temporary stay can be reviewed as staying somewhere to establish a residence for tax purposes. GitLab cannot provide you individual tax advice but you should always make sure to check with your tax advisor before traveling to any location where you will be performing work for an extended period of time, whether it is more than or less than 183 days. 

### Long-Term Relocation

#### Eligibility to Work

If you are interested in a possible long-term relocation (defined below), you need to confirm that you would be eligible to work in that location. [Except for the Netherlands](/handbook/people-group/visas/#right-to-immigrate-to-the-netherlands), GitLab does not provide any form of sponsorship or immigration aid for team members who choose to move to new countries.   For more information, please refer to our [Visa page](/handbook/people-group/visas). GitLab cannot assist or facilitate a process to help you become eligible to work in a location if you do not already have that eligibility. You are of course free to apply and gain that eligibility if there are steps you can take that do not involve GitLab.  Once you are certain that you are eligible to work in your requested Relocation country, you will need to provide proof of eligibility by [uploading the proof in the Documents tab of your Workday profile](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19B0lsMu7dMhof1ghPuBxHP23DuDqi2qpWF8pCWyEUN4/edit). If you move before establishing eligibility to work, but then cannot establish eligibility to work in the new location within the first six months of residency, it may affect your ability to continue your role with GitLab.

#### Long-Term Relocation Definition

A long-term relocation means that you will establish yourself in a new location outside of your current residential area. If you are ending your current residential living arrangement, spending more than six months in one calendar year in one location as part of an extensive period of travel and/or will have your mail delivered to an address in a different city, please follow the steps below.

It is at the company's discretion to determine whether it can approve the relocation:
  - Some job positions require GitLab team members to be located in particular countries, locations, regions, or time zones.  For example, a salesperson hired to serve a specific region may need to stay in that region.
  - GitLab may not have a scalable employment solution available in the country to which you intend to relocate. Review our [Country hiring guidelines](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#country-hiring-guidelines) to see if the country is eligible for a relocation. 
  - As noted above, you can only work in countries where you can establish eligibility to work in the country.
  - Relocation may also result in an adjustment to compensation, including equity eligibility, based on the location and the location factor.  The Company retains discretion to determine whether it can support such an adjustment.  

Assuming that relocation is approved, the location factor of the new location may result in an adjustment to compensation, including equity eligibility.  Depending on the location factor and the benefits offered in the particular country, this adjustment may result in an increase or a decrease to the compensation package.
At the onset, this practice sounds harsh when moving to a lower-paid location. One might argue that it seems unfair for the organization to pay someone less for the same work in the same role, regardless of where they go. However, if you look at it from another angle for a minute and compare this practice to what most companies do, it should make more sense. For example, say you work for a company with physical locations and say they haven't accepted that remote work is as productive as coming into the office yet. If you wanted to pack up and move to a location where they did not have a physical site, you would have no alternative but to resign and seek new employment in your new location. You would find quickly that companies in the area pay at a locally competitive rate.

Now, let's say the company did have a site in your new location and they offered the flexibility to transfer. If they did not have a similar position open, you would have to either apply for a different open position in the same company or resign and apply externally (back to the realization that other companies will pay at local competitive rate). If you were lucky enough that they did have a similar role in the new location, a transfer would come with a pay rate based on the local market to ensure equity across all incumbents (people in the job) by location.

Adjusting [pay according to the local market in all cases](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/) is fair to everyone. We can't remain consistent if we make exceptions to the policy and allow someone to make greater than local competitive rate for the same work others in that region are doing (or will be hired to do). We realize we might lose a few good people over this policy, but being fair to all team members is not negotiable. It is a value we stand behind and take very seriously.

## How To Apply for a Long-Term Relocation

#### Team Member 
1. Review the [Country hiring guidelines](/handbook/people-group/employment-solutions/#country-hiring-guidelines) to see if we can support your relocation. 
  _If you are moving to a different country, please start this process no later than **3 months** before your ideal relocation date.  If your relocation is within the same country, please start the process no later than 30 days before your ideal relocation date._
1. Upload eligibility documentation to Workday -  Per the [Eligibility to Work](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/relocation/#eligibility-to-work) section above. 
1. Send an email to your manager with your relocation details and request they respond with their approval. This allows our team to document the approval for future reference. Example below:

   > Hello Manager,
   > The first step in the [relocation process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/relocation/#how-to-apply-for-a-long-term-relocation) is to request approval via email.  Please respond to this thread with your review and approval/denial. 
   > - Current Location: 
   > - New Location: 
   > - Work Eligibility:

1. Upload the manager email (above) to your Workday profile. See [How to: Upload Documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19B0lsMu7dMhof1ghPuBxHP23DuDqi2qpWF8pCWyEUN4/edit)
1. Complete the [relocation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRyR2FG43izzVW2FrImUCNVWiMtIlA0JAFIJaO2V-ArzQs0Q/viewform).

Note: Assuming your relocation is approved, any applicable changes in compensation will not be effective until your move date (or the date you start working in the new location), which will be listed as the effective date on your new contract. **We will not be able to process retroactive dated relocations. Please only use future dates when applying for your relocation.**

### Approvals Phase
Below there is a description for the steps that need to be taken for approving a long term relocation. If the geographical location and/or country are different from the current location, the following steps will be followed: 

- If the relocation is within the exact same geographical location and country as linked to the team member’s current location factor, **no approval** is needed.  In this case team members can [update their address](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiNKWd-H9FTnYkmsWWi79-DGDSUCiWMfwFaGQPRnj14/edit) in the Contact tab in their Workday profile. Hereafter the People Connect Team member will confirm that the address has been updated in Workday and that there are no other steps necessary to complete the relocation process. 

1. A Relocation Form will be submitted by the team member, People Connect will need to audit the following; 
1. Check
  - [Location Eligibliy ](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/hiring_status/index) Check the [Compensation calculator, country hiring status ](https://comp-calculator.gitlab.net/hiring_status/index) to confirm where the company currently hires & what countries might be on hold due to upcoming conversions.  These are the only countries where team members can relocate.  For certain limited situations, the Company may be able to consider a scalable employment solution in new countries. You may open an [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/people-operations/General/-/issues/new#) by selecting the 'relocation_country_exception' template  and assign it to the Employment Solutions Partner. The Employment Solutions Partner and People Connect team can escalate to the Manager, People Connect, Director of Tax, and Director of Legal, Employment for further review.
  - [Work Eligiblity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/relocation/#eligibility-to-work)
  - Manager Approval Email 
     -  If the relocation is declined at any step, the People Connect Team member will relay this first to the TMR Team, who will work with People Connect, Total Rewards, and the team member’s manager to develop a basis for the declination to explain to the team member. 
1. The People Connect Team member will update the [Relocation Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z45eOZ2rCRIKgGae3eOKQ8lhIbAPikSs5gLz3V8Kh9U/edit?ts=5e7a2c42#gid=972787144) with the details of this relocation.




### Compensation Phase
1. Once previous relocation approvals have been received, start a confidential compensation thread email with the manager and total-rewards@gitlab.com. In the email, include the following; 
- Current Location & Location factor, complete comp range for the role
- New Location and & Location factor, complete comp range for the role
1. Hereafter the manager and Total Rewards review compensation with the intention to ensure a competitive rate in the new location compared to local market. The following factors are considered: 
- Current compa ratio
- Average compa ratio in the role/ pay equality
- Compensation differentials at compa ratio
- Performance of the team member
- Attrition risks
- Compensation that would be offered when hiring in that location
- Equity opportunities in the new location
1. General Guidelines for Compensation Adjustments for Relocations: 
- If a lower location factor: We typically don’t decrease compensation if the current compensation is in range when the team member is relocating within the same country. 
- If a higher location factor: We aim to keep the same compa ratio with 1.0 (median) as the maximum increase allocated. Team members should not have a higher compa ratio post relocation as performance/relocations should not be intertwined. 
1. The People Connect Team member will convert the approved compensation from USD to the local pay currency of the team member's new location, use the [rounding best practice](/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#rounding-best-practice) method, and then request approval from Total Rewards of this final compensation amount.
_Ex. Team member is approved $50,000 USD as their new comp and they are relocating to the Netherlands. Team members in the Netherlands are paid in Euro. Using the Jan 1, 2020 conversion, this converts to 44,577.20 Euro. Using the rounding best practice, the team member's comp will be 44,600 Euro, with Total Rewards approval._
1. The People Connect Team member will forward all approvals to the Total Rewards team at total-rewards@ gitlab.com so that they may review and approve any compensation change. 
1. If the relocation request relates to a _higher location factor_, forward previous approvals to the team member's Division's E-Group leader for their written approval. Where applicable, copy in the Director and VP of the Division in the email to the E-Group Leader, as they are closer to the process. This is to create visibility for them and an opportunity for them to halt the relocation if need be.
1. If the relocation request relates to a _lower location factor_ or _equivalent location factor (even if it is in the same country)_, continue to the next step.
1. The People Connect Team member will inform the Manager once the relocation has been fully approved.
1. The manager will convey to the team member that their relocation has been approved and relay their new compensation. 
1. If applicable, The People Connect Team member will inform the relevant Payroll team (`uspayroll @gitlab.com` or `nonuspayroll @gitlab.com`) for visibility on any upcoming changes.
1. The People Connect Team member will ensure that all approval documents including email threads are saved in the team member's [Workday `Contracts & Changes` folder](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ao_d_JxvqvZdqxlt4mBoHe1GcAhYT7B6YQoBgDxPdRE/edit). This approval will include the converted salary where applicable in order for the authorised signatory on the contract / adjustment letter to audit against before signing. 
1. The People Connect Team member will prepare a Relocation letter or new contract when applicable. If needed the People Connect team can assist in times of urgency. 

### Contract Phase 

The contract phase is unique based upon the team member's relocation. The different options are as follows; 
1. [Relocation within the Same Country ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/relocation/#relocation-within-the-same-country)
1. [Relocating to a new country ](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/relocation/#relocation-to-a-new-country)

#### Relocation within the Same Country

##### Tasks for People Connect 
1. A Relocation letter is only needed if there is a compensation change. If there is no change in compensation, then the People Connect Team member should direct the team member to update their address in the Contact tab in their Workday profile.

- Make a copy of the [Relocation letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18V9Qqlaetft8XMXLMPgbTFtZAGgoa7uiuN01-W38c6k/edit) and save it to the [working documents folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4eFM43gu7VPNUlKZEFtNGtSRk0?resourcekey=0-_qX_2OXbs71yJa3HZy0TAQ&usp=sharing).

- Enter all applicable information based on the approval email and the team member's Workday profile.

- Please note that the effective date of the change is the date of the expected move for the team member. If unsure, please confirm with the team member who is relocating. 

1. Once the Relocation letter has been created, ping the People Connect Team for auditing. 
1. Stage the letter in DocuSign and send for signature first to the Senior Manager, Total Rewards and subsequently to the team member.
1. Update the [Relocation Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z45eOZ2rCRIKgGae3eOKQ8lhIbAPikSs5gLz3V8Kh9U/edit?ts=5e7a2c42#gid=972787144) with the details of this relocation.

##### Tasks for the Team Member

1. [Update your address](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiNKWd-H9FTnYkmsWWi79-DGDSUCiWMfwFaGQPRnj14/edit) in the Contact tab in your Workday profile. Your address will then get approved by the People Connect Team member team.

##### Tasks for People Connect 

1. If the relocation has been approved, the People Connect Team member approves the address change in Workday and if applicable updates the [locality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hpPikG0STncYKamaY8XlfMTwYdoszP-0Xogvpp5hyZ4/edit) and [benefit group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MuRjPnvK9PZI2kk58jHnMgC3iUQCzp7xdjsfQpJT37k/edit)

If applicable The People Connect Team member also informs the relevant PEO.

#### Relocation to a New Country

- Note: If the team member is relocating away from a location with PEO Employment, they must give notice to the PEO directly, once the relocation has been approved. Most [notice periods](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#probation-periods-of-team-members-employed-through-a-peo-or-an-entity) are usually 30 days for Employee:PEO, and 2 weeks for Contractor:PEO (CXC) but the team member must review their own contract, as it will be specified there.

- Note: If the team member is moving to a different country with a PEO, ensure we coordinate with the new PEO about the change in contract. 
To be added

- Note: If the team member is moving to the US, employment authorisation (I-9) is required for legal purposes. The People Connect team will manage the [I-9 process](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/people-group/people-operations/people-connect/onboarding_process/#timing-of-i-9). 

##### Payroll set up (New Country)
- For team members relocating to a new country, it is possible there may be a delay as long as 6 weeks before their first payroll is disbursed. This is due to possible frequency changes, timing of the relocation (after the 10th of the month), availablity of new goverment documents. It is important to communicate this with the relocating team member to ensure they prepare for this possible delay. 


##### Tasks for People Connect 

1. Create a new [contract](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/) for the team member confirming new compensation (if applicable) and effective date.

The steps our People Connect Team member team uses to support relocations to the Netherlands in addition to above [relocation process](/handbook/people-group/relocation/#how-to-apply-for-a-long-term-relocation):
1. Once the Netherlands relocation contract has been signed,the People Connect Team member Team password-protects the signed contract and emails it to hr@savvy-group.eu.
To password protect on MAC: Download the document > open finder > right click > open with > preview

1. The vendor will supply all the documentation needed to apply for relocation including information about: [30% Ruling Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok6LS9T4P6tnPu2N6BDRDeveOYzd1ILpkbQRhl911w4/edit?ts=5caf1bca), [wage tax](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8N-idoYGFSCw2ajat9RscfQ004EL-PS/view) form and potentially an application for a BSN Number.
- **During COVID a letter stating your requirement to relocate to the Netherlands at such time is required, the People Connect team member will provide the vendor with such, using the following [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yE7DrHBLOj0blBJwaOIC8f2bLMFS10wYUZvg9BqjnF4/edit?ts=5e592e30)**

1. Sometimes the BSN might not be ready for the first Payroll, if this happens team members can still be on the Dutch Payroll, it just means the highest rate of tax will apply for this period. Any over paid tax can be claimed back via [a year end tax return](https://www.government.nl/topics/income-tax/filing-a-tax-return). When you receive your BSN please ensure to add to your Workday profile and email nonuspayroll@gitlab.com to let them know. Any Payroll queries should be directed to nonuspayroll@gitlab.com

- Relocation Contract and Mutual Termination Agreement Process for Germany

These are the steps our People Connect Team member team uses to send contracts to team members relocating to, or moving from Germany. Please note all German contracts require a wet signature.

Once the contract, tripartite agreement, or Mutual Termination Agreement (MTA) has been created by the People Connect Team member, next steps are to stage the documents in DocuSign, while also sending the documents to the signatories to have them physically sign and mail them. 

1. Stage the documents for siganture in DocuSign. This document will be sent to the Statutory Director first and then to the team member. Remember to use the personal email address of the team member.
  - Once signed, save the file into the team members Workday profile.
1. At the same time you stage the documents for signature in DocuSign, you will also need to email a copy of the document to both the Statutory Director as well as the team member.
  - In the body of the email, you will need to explain the below steps for the process.
  1. The Statutory Director will need to print two copies of the document. They will need to sign both of the copies, and then mail them to the team member. Please include the address and phone number of the team member in the email. 
  1. Once the team member receives the documents in the mail, they will keep one copy and then will need to sign and send the other copy to our German Counsel. The address for our German Counsel is listed in the PeopleOps 1password vault. Please include this address in the email.
  - The postage fees can be submitted for reimbursement. Please also include that information in the email.
  - It is also best practice to recommend in the email that the Statutory Director confirm that they have mailed the document.
1. Once the German Legal Counsel receives the documents, they will send a scanned copy of the signed documents to the People Connect team. This document will also need to be saved in the team members Workday profile.
