## Key Review
The metrics on this page are currently being re-organized according to what the People Group reports out every [Key Review](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/) meeting and [Group Conversation](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/group-conversations/). Below is a link to the most recent `Group Conversation` deck for Team Members to access in the interim.
