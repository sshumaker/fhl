# GitLab Channel Services Program

The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevOps Lifecycle in correlation to GitLab products. The program will help partners evaluate business opportunities and create a technical enablement framework to use as they build their GitLab-related service practices. 

The foundation of the GitLab Channel Services Program consists of two elements on which partners can build upon to start or grow their GitLab-related service portfolio:



1. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/services/#gitlab-certified-service-partner-program-overview">Badges</a>:  GitLab offers GitLab Service Partner Badges, that include training for service delivery teams which enable partners to meet program compliance requirements. 
2. <a href="https://partners.gitlab.com/prm/English/c/Services">GitLab Partner Portal Services Page</a>:  Partners can utilize GitLab Channel Service Packages to assist their teams as they build the service offerings, market and sell their services, and support their service business growth.

<br>We have designed the GitLab Channel Service Partner Program to help partners who focus on offering services as a key foundation in their business model. These services can include:  



*  Assessment
*  Migration
*  Integration
*  Implementation
*  Education
*  Optimization
*  Managed/hosted services
*  Security/compliance

Becoming an Open or Select GitLab partner or a GitLab Distribution partner is the first step to becoming a GitLab Service Partner and allows you to engage with the GitLab sales team and resell or refer GitLab products to your customers. Partners can achieve the GitLab Service Partner Program badges in addition to their program status to differentiate through their service offerings and unlock both financial and non-financial incentives as they achieve Service Partner Badges.

Whether you are a new partner just getting started with a service portfolio or you already have a thriving service business that you are looking to grow through offering services around GitLab, our GitLab Service Partner Program will offer you opportunities to build a successful business with GitLab.


## GitLab Service Partner Requirements and Progression

At GitLab, Service Partner Badges are meant to recognize service delivery excellence, technical expertise, and customer success among our partners for GitLab use cases in the DevOps lifecycle. Achieving a GitLab Service Partner Badge allows you to enhance your service capabilities and unlock key partner benefits in our program. 

![Service Program Requirements and Progression](/images/channel-service-program/service-program-requirements-and-progression.png)
<br>

## Becoming a Certified Service Partner

All GitLab Service Partner tracks have program compliance and training requirements that must be completed before you can obtain the associated certification.

When the Open, Select, or Distribution compliance criteria are met, and your organization sponsors the required number of practitioners who complete the training requirements and obtain the associated certifications and accreditations, your company will earn the related GitLab Service Partner Badge. 

The GitLab Channel team will communicate the award in email, and reflect the certification in the GitLab Partner Locator. 

All GitLab Service Partner Badges are reviewed periodically. Non-compliant partners at the time of the review will have one quarter to return to compliance.

## Partner Service Community


### Overview

This community is designed to allow partner service delivery teams to directly collaborate on project specific challenges with the internal GitLab technical teams. The community will benefit the GitLab Certified Service Partners by:



1. Extending the technical service enablement beyond the certification curriculum and into the real world. 
2. Serving as a knowledge base of delivery patterns and best practices.
3. Reducing delivery risk by applying best practices of GitLab practitioners worldwide.  

Learn about this community in [this video](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18613/472525). 




### Accessing the Community

## Maintaining Service Partner Badges

At GitLab, collaboration and feedback is meant to nurture and mentor our service partners to grow their service capabilities and expertise. The program will utilize our internal [customer success metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/vision/#measurement-and-kpis) to measure and understand the GitLab customer experience across the entire ecosystem and help further develop our cservice partners. In order to work together in this process, we will ask each service partner to provide evidence (as stated in the program descriptions above) to support the periodic  review  for your customer set one month before it is due. 

GitLab Channel Partner program will review the GitLab Service Partnersโ customer success rating and practitioner certification status each year in the month the partner was originally granted certification. Partners will be notified with the outcome of the review and the resulting status of their certification. If the partner needs to make further investments to stay in good standing with regards to Service Partner Certifications, the email will indicate the existing status and state the expected status with a due date when compliance is required to renew your GitLab Service Partner Badge. Partners can work with their GitLab Channel Account Manager (CAM) to create a plan for obtaining and maintaining badges.
