## Introduction

The GitLab Channel Partner Program offers market-leading training, tools, and support to help accelerate sales opportunities and grow your business with GitLab. The following information is intended to help our partners understand our program.

## Program Requirements, Benefits, and Guidelines

The GitLab Partner Program consists of two tracks that support the different ways our partners go to market, Open and Select:

**1. Open –** The Open track is for all partners (resellers, integrators, sales, and services) in the DevOps space, IT as a service (ITaaS) and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevOps practice buildout. The Open track is also for partners seeking to develop customers or that just want to learn about GitLab and participate in the GitLab partner community. 

Partners may or may not be transacting partners, and qualifying partners can earn product discounts, referral fees and partner services incentives. We provide:
* Broad Sales and Services Enablement
* Discounts and Referral Fees
* GitLab Badges   
* Field Support

Open partners must meet the minimum requirements outlined in the section Program Requirements and Benefits below to earn program benefits, including:
* Completion of GitLab Sales Professional certification in the region specified in your GitLab Partner Contract.
* Technical Sales certifications in the region specified in your GitLab Partner Contract. Both the GitLab Sales Architect Core and Professional Services Engineering courses meet this requirement.

**2. Select –** In this track, partners make a greater investment in expertise, develop services practices around GitLab, and are expected to drive greater product recurring revenues. In return, Select partners have a dedicated Channel Sales Manager and greater investment. Participation in the Select track is by invitation only. We provide:
* Focused Strategic Relationships (Channel Account Manager, Solution Architect, Executives)

* Verifications (completion of GitLab Sales Core) and certification (Sales Core plus Advanced Use Case Training) in the region specified in your GitLab Partner Contract.
* Technical Sales certifications in the region specified in your GitLab Partner Contract. Both the GitLab Sales Architect Core and Professional Services Engineering courses meet this requirement.

## The Services Program
GitLab has created a Services program that enables, trains, certifies and provides incentives to partners that deliver services to GitLab customers. The GitLab Channel Services program is designed to help new or existing partners design service portfolios around the DevOps Lifecycle, helping customers transition to a single DevOps Platform with GitLab.
