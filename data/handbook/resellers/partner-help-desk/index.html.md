## Channel Manager Ownership in SFDC - Accounts and Opportunities

### Channel Manager Account Ownership

Channel Managers are managed differently depending on the region they are in. 
- US PubSec Channel Managers each have owned partner accounts. 
- All other regions of the world have Select Channel Managers assigned to specific areas, and Commercial Channel Managers (who handle Open Partners) assigned to specific areas. See below for the region breakdown. 

When there are changes to each channel team, the corresponding PHD Specialist should create an MR with the update. The Channel Marketing team updates the CAMs in Impartner.

When updating the Account Owner on a partner account, make sure to also update the `Contracted Territories` field.

#### Updating an Account Owner in SFDC (Channel Accounts ONLY)
1. Navigate to the account record in SFDC.
2. Under the `GitLab Partner Program Info`, check to make sure the “Public Sector Partner” field is set to “No.” (Unless the account is US PubSec.)
3. Click the `Change Account Owner` button at the top of the record. 
4. Type in the Channel Manager’s name, and then click “Save.” Do not change any check boxes.

### Channel Manager Opportunity Ownership
(How to tell which Channel Manager is assigned to an Opportunity)

In the [CAM Mapping FY23](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1okdK1HoqM-POt6GySRadeFp5AWf0rJY43GoScUq0EX0/edit#gid=974923348) spreadsheet (“Mapping Tables” tab), (Non-US PubSec or Alliance) Channel Managers are mapped first by the Opp Owner’s User Data using the field `[Deprecated] Owner Segment-Geo-Region-Area,` and then secondarily by the field `Stamped Account Sales Territory.` These fields are found in the 'Comp and Attainment Information` section of an opportunity.   

When determining which Channel Manager is mapped to an opportunity, First look up the `[Deprecated] Owner Segment-Geo-Region-Area` field. If there’s a Channel Manager listed, that is the Channel Manager for the opportunity. If, instead of a Channel Manager, it says “Look at Territory,” then refer to the `Stamped Account Sales Territory` column. That name will be the Channel Manager for the opportunity.    

US PubSec and Alliance Channel Managers are mapped according to the partner and are listed on the two left-hand sections of the same spreadsheet. If the partner account is a GSI, use the GSI lookup columns on the far right of the spreadsheet.


## Receiving Reseller Purchase Orders, Quote Requests, and Order Status Requests 
As of FY23Q4, there should not be any resellers sending quote requests, orders, or order status requests to the Partner Support email box. Partners should be sending these to the Sales person or CAM assigned to their opportunity (see the [Channel Ops handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#opportunity-requirements-to-request-a-quote) if you need to provide a link to Sales). 

If the partner doesn't know who that is or who to send their request to, they can then email Partner Order Operations (partnerorderops@gitlab.com). 
The [Common Response Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iPJh3sP6p3fc_FfJPe7d5uzWThe6FJ5W_3arGFm2Dj4/edit#gid=0) has been updated with scripts for various scenarios, explained below with the complete process for each.   

### Reseller Quote Request, PO Submission, or Status Request that includes Partner Order Operations (Partner Support was just copied)
Reply using the response from the [Common Response Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iPJh3sP6p3fc_FfJPe7d5uzWThe6FJ5W_3arGFm2Dj4/edit#gid=0). No additional steps are necessary.   

### Reseller Quote Request, PO Submission, or Status Request that does _not_ include Partner Order Operations as an email recipient
1. Look up the opportunity and confirm who the Field Seller/ISR is.
2. Reply to the email and reattach any documents that came with the original email. 
3. Add the sales rep, ISR, CAM on the opportunity ([not necessarily the CAM who owns the account](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/partner-help-desk/#channel-manager-opportunity-ownership)), and add partnerorderops@gitlab.com to the “cc” field.
4. **For PO Submissions Only** Attach the PO to the correct opportunity in SFDC.
5. Reply using the appropriate response from the [Common Response Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iPJh3sP6p3fc_FfJPe7d5uzWThe6FJ5W_3arGFm2Dj4/edit#gid=0). 

## NFRs
More information to come soon!

### Teaching a Partner to Reduce Seats in a SaaS NFR
1. Let the partner know how many seats are in use, and copy the screenshot from support if it was provided. 
2. Link the [NFR Policy](NFR policy)
3. Add additional links for assistance:
   - [Determining Seat Usage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/#how-seat-usage-is-determined)
   - [See a complete view of usage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/#view-seat-usage)
4. Let them know they can confirm or remove users on the "Seats Quote Tab."
5. Once the partner replies that they have decreased their seats, update the support ticket for the NFR. 

### Confirming the version of a SaaS NFR (Premium or Ultimate)
To help a partner confirm what version their SaaS NFR is running, direct them to the “Group Billing Page.” They can navigate to their billing page with the following url:
https://gitlab.com/groups/[The Partner’s Specific Namespace]/-/billings
More information can be found in [View your GitLab SaaS subscription](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/#view-your-gitlab-saas-subscription)

### Adding Additional Minutes to a SaaS NFR
If a CAM needs help requesting additional minutes for a Partner’s SaaS NFR, please refer them to the [NFR Requests for GitLab SaaS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZUEN4Wo5_FiP3Q0nC5mE9na1CG-PylZJ7MNcJ2teao/edit?usp=sharing) document. The Partner Help Desk is not enabled to handle or process requests for more minutes. 


## Invoices
More information to come soon!

### Partner Invoices
Partner invoices can be found on the Partner Account Record in SFDC under `Invoices.` It helps to either have the date of the transaction and/or when the related opportunity was Closed-Won in the system. 

## Service Attach PoE
Operational instructions for the Partner Help Desk's role in Service Attach PoEs can be found on the [Channel Operations handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/channel-operations/#service-attach-opportunities).

When a partner emails partnersupport@gitlab.com with a Statement of Work (SOW) or Proof of Execution (PoE):
1. Open the document and ensure the following data is included (if any information is missing, reply back to the partner and ask for it):
   - Partner Name
   - Customer Name
   - Service Attach Deal ID
2. Save a copy of the document for later upload to the system
3. Search SFDC using the provided Deal ID
4. Click on the Registration Record (and take note of the assigned Channel Manager)
5. Change the Deal Registration `Status` from "Approved" to "Closed-Won"
6. Navigate to the `Linked Opportunity` and chatter the Channel Manager who approved the Deal Registration
   - In the chatter, upload the downloaded PoE document and tell the Channel Manager you've uploaded the document as well as updated the Service Attach registration to "Closed-Won."
7. Reply to the partner and let them know that the PoE has been submitted.

8. For "Which Records," choose "All found records." For "Which Columns?" choose "Current view." Then click "Export."
9. Open the download in either Numbers or Excel.

11. Change all the fields labeled “True” to an “X.” 
12. Save the spreadsheet as a .csv file, and attach that to the email to the partner.


## Letters of Authorization (LoAs)
A Partner must be at least [Open Compliant](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-GitLab/#training--certification-requirements-for-transactions-deal-registrations-nfrs-and-letters-of-authorization-loas) before they can receive a Letter of Authorization from GitLab. 

Compliant Partners can request LoAs directly from the portal (this process is also documented in the partner guide):
1. Go to partners.gitlab.com → Support → Letter of Authorization
2. The partner will be sent to Docusign to add in their company name. When they hit submit, it starts a chain of events:
   - Docusign sends an email to PHD to confirm that the partner is authorized. Once this is done…
   - Docusign sends an email to Legal to confirm whatever legal stuff they need to confirm. Once this is done…
   - Docusign sends a completed Letter of Authorization to the partner who requested it, and an email to PHD alerting us that it has been completed.

The PDF of the authorization letter can be downloaded at any time, but it will not have the date or legal stamp on it until Legal approves it. Since there are manual approvals, it may take a bit. SLA is 2 business days. 

### Approving Letters of Authorization
When a partner requests a Letter of Authorization, an email will be sent to the Partner Support email box with the subject line, “ GitLab LOA: [Name of Person Requesting LoA].”
1. Click on the “Review Document” link in the email to open DocuSign.
2. Open the document and view the _company_ name on the document. 
3. Open Salesforce and input the name of the company in the search bar. Hit enter. 
4. In the “GitLab Partner Program Info” section of the Partner Account record, check the `Partner Status` field says “Authorized.” 
5. Open the [GitLab Certification Tracking Dashboard V2.0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PnjHrOtZAYlkQpNoSsAzNt0sT1oZh76Xy2x33CfCQ9k/edit?pli=1#gid=1799234939) and navigate to the “Certifications by Partner” tab. 
6. Use the CMD+F function and search the name of the partner organization.
7. Look to Column G, “Open Reqs Met?” and confirm the field says “Yes.”
8. In Docusign, click the “Approve” button.
9. Add the “LOA” tag to the email.

### Denying Letters of Authorization
Follow the steps for [Approving a Letter of Authorization](include link when available). If, during the process, any of the following happen, you must deny the letter:
- Partner Status is _not_ authorized
- Open Reqs Met is _no_

To Deny the Letter of Authorization
1. In Docusign, click the “Other Actions” button, and choose “Deny to Sign” from the options that become available.
2. Confirm denial.
3. In the box that appears, refer to the [PHD Common Response Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iPJh3sP6p3fc_FfJPe7d5uzWThe6FJ5W_3arGFm2Dj4/edit?usp=sharing) row for “LoA Denial in Docusign.”
4. Press “Confirm.
5. Open a new email from the Partner Support email box, and address it to the person whose name came with the LoA request. Copy partnersupport@gitlab.com and the Channel Manager assigned to the account. 
6. Refer to the [PHD Common Response Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iPJh3sP6p3fc_FfJPe7d5uzWThe6FJ5W_3arGFm2Dj4/edit?usp=sharing) row for “LoA Denial.” Copy the provided subject line and text into the email. Personalize the email with the partner name and any other pertinent information. Do not forget to update the “trainings needed” section in the body of the email. 
7. Hit Send.
8. Add the “LOA” tag to the email.

### LoAs for Partners with Specific Needs
If a partner needs a tailored LoA, have the Channel Manager open an SFDC case by navigating to the partner account record and clicking "Legal Request."

### Reporting a Problem with LoAs
To report a problem with the LoA process, open an issue on the Legal Channel's project, and tag Kristen Tesh, Jade Allum, and Matthew Taylor.


## Partner Support Google Group Management
