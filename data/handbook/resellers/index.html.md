## How the Program Works

### Partner Program Tracks
The GitLab Partner Program consists of two tracks to support the different ways our partners go to market:

1. **Open –** This track is for all partners (resellers, integrators, sales, and services) in the DevOps space ,IT as a service (ITaaS) and other adjacent spaces that are committed to investing in their DevOps practice buildout. GitLab Open partners may or may not be transacting partners, and qualifying partners can earn product discounts, referral fees and services incentives.

2. **Select –** In this track, partners make a greater investment in GitLab sales expertise, develop services practices around GitLab, and are expected to drive greater GitLab product recurring revenues. In return, Select partners have a dedicated Channel Sales Manager and greater investment, including access to Marketing Development Funds (MDF). **The Select track is by invitation only.**

### Getting Started with GitLab
To engage with GitLab, partners start by completing the online Channel Partner registration process on [partners.gitlab.com](https://partners.gitlab.com) which leads partners through executing the GitLab Partner Agreement and getting access to our Partner Portal where partners complete their onboarding. The GitLab Partner Agreement must be executed by an authorized signatory of the partner organization. 

Execution of the Master Partner Agreement results in  access to the GitLab Partner Portal.  Other members of your team will be able to register and be associated with your account by registering at [partners.gitlab.com](https://partners.gitlab.com). At that time, you will  have access to sales tools, technical resources, and training courses. Once one member of your team completes the GitLab Sales Core training, your company will also be able to enter deal registrations and referral transactions.
