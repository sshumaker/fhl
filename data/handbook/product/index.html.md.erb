## Welcome to the Product Team Handbook

- The Product Team  is led by [David DeSanto](/company/team/#david)
- The Product Handbook focuses on _how_ we do product at GitLab.
- Please see [Product Direction](/direction/) to learn about _what_ the Product Team plans to build

## Product Team Functions

- [Product Management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#product-management)
- [Product Monetization](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-monetization)
- [Product Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-operations)
- [User Experience](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/)

## Product Team Mission

**We create products and experiences that customers love and value.**

- **Consistency wins as you scale**. Our organizational goal is to create a Product Manager (PM) system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members.
- **We are shipping an experience**, and not just a product. Don’t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc.
- **It’s about our customers and doing a job for them**, not the product itself. Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology.
- **It’s about love AND value**. Will customers value what we are building? We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value.

## Contributing to the Product Handbook 

The product handbook is widely referenced by product managers and cross-functional team members. Therefore, we want to follow a consistent change management process so all affected collaborators are aligned and informed when there are changes (specially new requirements, processes, meetings, etc.) that affect their workflow. To help ensure awareness across teams, when suggesting a change to the product handbook, please use the `Change-Product-Handbook` [merge request description template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Change-Product-Handbook.md). This ensures your changes are included in [Product Operations Releases](/handbook/product/product-operations/#product-operations-releases). 

This template will also help you out by automatically adding labels and assigning required reviewers.

You will also be asked to indicate which type of change you are suggesting:
* Small improvement (typos, clarifications, etc.)
* Adding a new section
* Modifying existing section
* Documenting a new process
* Adding a new page or directory
* Other

For a small improvement, please feel free to merge the MR yourself. Otherwise, the template will ping Product Operations for collaboration and review, and the guidance below should be followed for driving awareness: 

### Informing team members about the changes

It is your responsibility to communicate with relevant team members about your merge request. Here are some best practices to follow:

- For significant changes affecting the whole Product or Engineering team, consult Product Operations for the best communication strategy.
- For changes specific to product management, tag `@gl-product` in the merge request before merging.
- Indicate in the comment whether you are requesting contributions and feedback or simply providing information.
- For changes relevant to other teams, tag department leads such as the VP of UX, VP of Development, or the Director of Quality Engineering in the merge request before merging.
- Share and cross-post the merge request link with a brief description in relevant channels such as Slack `#product`, `#product-leadership`, `#eng-managers`, and `#ux-managers`.
- Add the merge request as a read-only or discussion topic in the [Weekly Product Management Meeting](/handbook/product/product-processes/#weekly-product-management-meeting).
- For more guidance on communication, refer to the [GitLab Communication tips and best practices](/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices).

### Communicating with the Product Division

Below are team emails and handles that can be used for different departments and sub-departments in the Product Division. These groups are used for internal communication and the `@mention` can only be used by project members. Please remember that tagging `@mention` on issues will generate in-product [to-do items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/todos.html) and email notifications to **all** team members in that project, so use it only when you need to communicate with the entire team. For communication specifically for product managers, please leverage [How to Engage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/how-to-engage/).

- `@gl-product-leadership` tags all group managers, directors and VPs in the Product Division 
- `@gl-product-plt` tags all direct reports to the VP Product in the Product Division
- `@gl-product` tags to all members of Product Management, Product Monetization and Product Operations in the Product Division
- `product@gitlab.com` emails all members of Product Management, Product Monetization and Product Operations in the Product Division
- `ux-department@gitlab.com` emails all members of UX (UX Research, Technical Writing and Product Design) in the Product Division
- `@gitlab-com/gitlab/-ux` tags all members of UX (UX Research, Technical Writing and Product Design) in the Product Division
- `@gitlab-com/gitlab-ux/managers` tags all people managers within UX (UX Research, Technical Writing, and Product Design)
- `@gitlab-com/gitlab-ux/designers` tags all Product Designers and Design Managers in UX
- `@gl-docsteam` for all Technical Writers in UX 

When you are tagging `@mention`:

- Clearly state why you are tagging the entire product team and what action you need product team members to take.
- Write a short summary in the same comment so team members can quickly understand the necessary context.
- Review the issue title and description to ensure it has relevant details other product team members need **BEFORE** submitting the comment. The issue title will be the subject of email notifications and in-product to-do items.
- If asking team members to review a change, please directly link to the specific page on the [review app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/#how-review-apps-work) and any relevant issues or MRs.
