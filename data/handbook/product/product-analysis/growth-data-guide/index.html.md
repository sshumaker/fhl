## Objectives for this Page

1. Enable Growth team members of all SQL abilities to build their own queries and make simple customizations to fit their needs.
2. Alert all team members on newly discovered caveats, query improvements, or data changes that may impact current or future reports.
3. Educate all team members on best practices when writing queries for growth-focused data.

## Differences in Growth Data Needs

Growth data insights are often driven by time-to metrics (time to adoption, time to conversion) which requires a much more granular approach to data insights on a namespace- or user-level. Growth data insights are often grouped by the date of creation (just as namespace creation, user creation, or trial started).

## Snippet & Query Templates (for Sisense)

_This will provide a centralized location to find key snippets built for Growth data interests and that are tailored to allow for stated filtering needs._

### About Snippets

Snippets are great ways to allow Sisense users to build charts without writing any SQL. Below is a list of snippets created specifically to help answer growth-related questions and have built-in data source joins to enable enhanced data granularity and filtering capabilities.

Some of the benefits of using these snippets include:
- Save time without having to constantly rewrite SQL code with multiple joins
- Snippets already automatically filter (or allow the option to filter) for key dimensions such as `setup_for_company` selection and `namespace_type`
- Using unified set of snippets will allow for more consistent reporting

### Using Snippets

These snippets can be inserted into the SQL code for a Sisense chart in two ways:
- Insert the snippet name in square brackets (`[insert_snippet_name_here]`)
- Copy/paste the SQL code for the snippet from the GitLab repository. 
  - This approach is primarily helpful if you need to add any customizations to the query (such as integrating different data tables).

Please note that the underlying queries for these snippets may change on occasion. If you copy/paste these snippet code, later changes won't be reflected in your reports. If you use the square bracket approach, any reports using these snippets will automatically update if the snippet code is updated.

#### Enabling Filters Required by Snippets

As listed below in the documentation for each snippet, there will be a series of _filtering options_ that need to be enabled on your Sisense report. To do this, please complete the following steps (screenshots coming soon):

1. Go to the Sisense dashboard where you are using the snippet(s).
2. Click on the Settings menu (hamburger menu) on the top-right of page and click the "Enable Filters" option.
3. Click on the "Filters (0)" dropdown button on the top-left of the dashboard.
4. Click the cog icon on the right-side of the Filters menu.
5. In the "Hidden" side of the "Manage Filters" pop-up, select any of the filters shown in the "Filtering Options" section of the snippet documentation so that they show up in the "Visible" section with a checkmark.
6. Close-out of the "Manage Filters" section and choose the preferred filtering options for the newly-enabled filters.

#### Group Namespace Invites & Member Counts

_Group namespace-level invites. More details on invite data [below](/handbook/product/product-analysis/growth-data-guide/#invites)_

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Options for accessing this snippet:**
- Copy/paste `[growth_data_group_namespace_invites]` into your Sisense report.
- Copy/paste [SQL code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/periscope/-/blob/periscope/master/snippets/growth_data_group_namespace_invites/growth_data_group_namespace_invites.sql) to customize query within your Sisense report.

**Dashboards:**

The [Invite Acceptance Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab:safe-dashboard/922565/Invite-Acceptance-Dashboard) 
is a good jumping-off point for working with this data. It leverages the more granular snippet 
detailed below, `[growth_data_group_namespace_invites_w_metadata]`.
- Note: This dashboard is in the SAFE space. Instructions on how to request access [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/#accessing-a-safe-dashboard)

**Granularity:** One record per invited user per namespace (one record per `member_id`)

_Note: Currently this snippet only looks at invitations to the top-level namespace. It does not include invites to sub-groups or projects. This will be updated in a future iteration but is an important caveat when using the snippet in its current state._

Since the grain is at the member level, there can be multiple records per user (one for each 
namespace they have been invited to) and multiple records per namespace (one per invited user). 
Please be careful of this when `JOIN`ing to other tables! You need to join on both the `user_id` 
and the `namespace_id` to avoid potential errors or duplicate records.

**Dependencies:** Snippet includes `[growth_data_namespaces]` snippet

**Data Sets Used:** 

- `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_namespaces_xf`
- `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_users_blocked_xf`

- `invite_created_at`: Timestamp that user was invited to namespace
- `invite_accepted_at`: Timestamp that user accepted the invitation (will be `NULL` if access was 
automatically granted)
- `invite_expires_at`: Timestamp of invite expiration, defined as `invite_created_at` + 90 days 
(unless explicitly set by inviter)
- `invite_success_at`: Timestamp that user joined the namespace (either via invite acceptance 
or access granted)
- `user_created_at`: Timestamp of user creation
- `invited_user_type`: `'NEW'` (user did not have GitLab account at time of invite) or 
`'EXISTING'` (user had GitLab account at time of invite)
- `invite_status`: Current status of invite: `'INVITE_ACCEPTED'`, `'ACCESS_GRANTED'`, 
'`INVITE_EXPIRED'`, `'INVITE_PENDING'`

## Resources for Growth Experimentation

_Collection of snippets, query templates, and dashboards designed to facilitate experimentation analysis._

### Experimentation Events Snippet

_Sisense snippet that can easily be adjusted any experiment using Snowplow events data._

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Granularity:** One record per `event_id`

**Data Sets Used:**

- `legacy.snowplow_structured_events_all`
- `legacy.snowplow_gitlab_events_experiment_contexts_all`

**Fields:**

- `event_id`: Unique identifier of Snowplow event
- `experiment_name`
- `experiment_variant`
- `context_key`
- `derived_tstamp`: Timestamp of event (with millisecond granularity)
- `event_action`
- `event_property`
- `event_value`
- `environment`: `'production'` or `'staging'` (based on `app_id`)

**Filtering Options (if filters aren't enabled, will show all results):**

- `select_experiment`: Applied to `experiment_name`
- `DateRange`: Applied to `derived_tstamp`
- `snowplow_environment`: `'production'` or `'staging'`

_NOTE: Due to the size of the Snowplow data set and performance concerns, please be sure to apply, 
at minimum, the `select_experiment` filter. Queries will be much more performant if you also 
apply the `DateRange` filter._

**Sample Output:**

``` sql
WITH events AS ([experiment events])

SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE experiment_name = 'new_repo'
LIMIT 10
;
```

</details>

### Experimentation Funnel Sisense Query Template

_Template for calculating a funnel with multiple Snowplow events_

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Granularity:** One record per stage

**Dependencies:** Utilizes the `[Experiment Events]` snippet

**Data Sets Used:**
- `legacy.snowplow_structured_events_all`
- `legacy.snowplow_gitlab_events_experiment_contexts_all`

**How to Use:** 

_Note: Unlike the other snippets listed, this is meant to be used as a query template. The reason being is the user has to adjust this template to fit the specifications needed for the experiment such as number of events in the funnel, which fields are needed for filtering, and other requirements. There is documentation listed within the query template to help guide you to make the needed customizations._

1. Copy and paste SQL code into a new Sisense report.
2. Within the Sisense report, update relevant fields such as `event_action`, `event_label`, and `experiment_name` to fit the experiment you are analyzing.
3. This template includes six unique events, if the funnel you are trying to track needs more or less, just remove or copy the "step_x" table format to fit your experiment's needs.
4. If adding or removing the number of events in the funnel, make sure to remove any mentions or joins in the query involving that table.

**Note on Results:** For a `context_key` to be counted in later steps, that same key must be present in all previous steps. For example, a `context_key` that is recorded as a step three conversion would also have to be present in steps one and two.

**Sample Output:**

_Date-level granularity can be removed._

</details>

### Experiment Data Validation Dashboard

_At a glance, see if the experiment is reporting data, for which events, and what the candidate/control distribution looks like._

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

**[Visit Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/860363/Experiment-Data-Validation)**

**How to Use:** 

- Select your experiment in the `select_experiment` filter dropdown. Data for your experiment will load in approximately two to five minutes.
- Scan through reports to see if all intended events are reporting, and see when they first- and last-reported data.
- View various bar and line charts to see if there were any data outages that might impact the results of the experiment.

## Key Data Source Guide

_A brief guide clarifying the granularity, important fields, recommended filters, and any data constraints or quality issues that come with using these data sets._

### Namespaces

_Provides helpful fields on every namespace such as the `dim_namespace_id`, `created_at` date, and `namespace_type`._

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

`common.dim_namespace` [(dbt)](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_namespace)

**[Data Team's Data Guide to Namespace Analysis](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/namespace/)** 

**[Product Data Insights documented differences between legacy and common models](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/363)** 

**Summary:** Provides helpful fields on every namespace such as the `dim_namespace_id`, `created_at` date, and `namespace_type`. This can be joined with numerous event, subscription, and member tables. In addition, this table can usefully be joined to certain user-centric tables for enhanced filtering capabilities such as removing blocked users and filtering for namespaces that are set up for a company account.

**Granularity:** 1 record per namespace

**Key Filters:**

- `namespace_is_internal = FALSE`: Excludes internal namespaces
- `ultimate_parent_namespace_id = dim_namespace_id`: Includes only top-level namespaces
- `namespace_type = 'Group'`: Recommended since most Growth initiatives are built around Group namespaces

**Items of Note:**

- Plan-related and member count data points: Since there is only one record per namespace, that means plan changes are not captured in this data set. Especially from a Growth mindset, the plan at certain points in a namespace's lifecycle (namespace creation, 90 days after creation, etc) and the transition from one plan to the next (such as Free to Trial to Paid) are more helpful. Please reference [common.dim_namespace_plan_hist](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_namespace_plan_hist) and [common.dim_namespace_hist](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.dim_namespace_hist) documentation which outline models containing historical snapshots.

</details>

### Invites

_Two main tables used to calculate invites, [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_members) 
and [`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_memberships)._

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Two different types of "invites"**

There are two main invite use cases:

1. An invite is sent to the user and they need to accept it in order to join the namespace. The 
invited user needs to take action in order to accept the invite.
    - This happens when the invited user does not yet have a GitLab.com account that is visible 
    to the invitee. In most cases this is because the invited user does not yet have a GitLab.com 
    account
    - If invite is accepted, `invite_status = 'INVITE_ACCEPTED'`
    - If invite is not accepted, `invite_status = 'INVITE_PENDING'` or 
    `invite_status = 'INVITE_EXPIRED'`
2. An actual invite is not sent, the user is added to the namespace automatically. The invited 
user does _not_ need to take any action to accept the invite. The Product Analysis team refers 
to this as the "access granted" use case.
    - This happens when the invited user already has a GitLab.com account that is visible 
    to the inviter (ex: public profile, within the same organization, etc). 
    - `invite_status = 'ACCESS_GRANTED'`

`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` ([dbt](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_members))

**Summary:** `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` is a type 2 table with records for both successful and 
unsuccessful invites.

- This is a type 2 table with multiple records per primary key, `member_id` (unique to the 
`user_id` and `source_id`)
  - Type 2 documented in source table: [`PREP.gitlab_dotcom.gitlab_dotcom_members_source`](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_members_source#description)
  - There is only one record per primary key (`member_id`) where `is_currently_valid = TRUE`
- A record is added any time a user is invited to a namespace/group/project (regardless of 
whether an actual invite is sent or access is automatically granted) OR any time a user's status 
changes (ex: their [permissions change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#group-members-permissions))

**Notable columns:**

- `member_id`: Unique identifier specific to the `user_id` and `source_id` (namespace/group/project)
- `user_id`: Unique identifier of invited user
- `source_id`: Unique identifier of namespace/group/project user is invited to (ex: `namespace_id`)
- `member_source_type`: Type of entity user is invited to (`'Namespace'` or `'Project'`)
- `invite_created_at` Timestamp of invite creation
  - Populated for all invites, even if they fall into the "access granted" use case
- `invite_accepted_at`: Timestamp of invite acceptance
  - Only populated when the invited user needed to take action to accept the invite. This column 
  is `NULL` for the "access granted" use case
- `access_level`: Numeric value that represents the member's [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html#members) 
at a point in time
  - Note: Since this is a type 2 table, this value can differ across records if a member's 
  permissions change

`legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships` ([dbt](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_memberships))

**Summary:** `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships` has records if a user successfully joins a 
group/namespace/project (the user has a "membership").

- A record is added _after_ a user is successfully added to a namespace/group/project, either 
via invite acceptance or access automatically granted.

**Notable columns:**

- `user_id`: Unique identifier of namespace/group/project member
- `membership_source_id`: Unique identifier of namespace/group/project
- `is_billable`: Boolean denoting whether a member should be counted toward the seat count 
for a subscription ([source](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.gitlab_dotcom_memberships#description))
  - Note: This also applies to namespaces/groups/projects without a subscription
- `access_level`: Numeric value that represents the member's current [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html#members)
  - Note: This captures the member's _current_ `access_level`. Use `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` 
  to view historic

**Example of how and when different use cases appear in the two tables:**

Invite sent use case:

1. User A invites user B to join namespace 1. User B does not have a GitLab.com account, so an 
invite is sent to the specified email address
    - A record is added to `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members`
1. User B accepts invitation to join namespace 1
    - The record in `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` updated to reflect time of acceptance 
    (`invite_accepted_at IS NOT NULL`)
    - A record is added to `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`

Access granted use case:

1. User A invites user B to join namespace 1. User B has a GitLab.com account, and is 
automatically granted access to namespace 1.
    - A record is added to `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` (where `invite_accepted_at IS NULL`)
    - A record is added to `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`

**Invite status**

Product Analysis uses the following to define `invite_status`:

- `INVITE_ACCEPTED`: Appears in memberships table, `invite_accepted_at IS NOT NULL`
- `ACCESS_GRANTED`: Appears in memberships table, `invite_accepted_at IS NULL`
- `INVITE_EXPIRED`: Does not appear in the memberships table, `invite_created_at` over 90 days ago 
OR past inviter-specified `invite_expires_at`
  - Invites expire after 90 days per [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project)
- `INVITE_PENDING`: Does not appear in the memberships table, `invite_created_at` in last 90 days OR 
before inviter-specific `invite_expires_at`

**Successful invites**

Invites with either the `INVITE_ACCEPTED` or `ACCESS_GRANTED` status are considered to be 
"successful" invites. Since there is no single column in either table that represents the 
time a user successfully joined the namespace/group/project, the Product Analysis team uses the 
following definition for `invite_success_at` (as of December 2021):

- `IFF(memberships.user_id IS NOT NULL, IFNULL(members.invite_accepted_at, members.invite_created_at), NULL)`

We use `invite_success_at` to determine member counts at any point in time.

**"Invite Acceptance Rate" Calculations**

The methodology to calculate "invite acceptance rate" has changed over time:

- Until mid-2021, invite acceptance rate included `ACCESS_GRANTED` invites in the denominator, 
but not in the numerator. As such, the metric was under-reported.
- Starting in mid-2021, invite acceptance rate only includes invites actually sent in the 
denominator (`ACCESS_GRANTED` invites are excluded).
- Starting in mid-2021, Product Analysis started reporting "invite success rate", which includes 
both use cases (invite sent and access granted) in the numerator and the denominator.

**Member `access_level`/permissions**

As noted above, `access_level` is present in both `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` and `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships`

- `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_members` will track changes to a member's `access_level` over time
- `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships` represents the member's current `access_level`

Here is a `CASE` statement that can be used to map the [numeric values to permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html#members)

``` sql
SELECT
  access_level,
  CASE access_level --https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html#members
    WHEN 50 THEN 'Owner'
    WHEN 40 THEN 'Maintainer'
    WHEN 30 THEN 'Developer'
    WHEN 20 THEN 'Reporter'
    WHEN 10 THEN 'Guest'
    WHEN 5 THEN 'Minimal Access'
  END AS member_permissions,
  COUNT(*)
FROM legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
;
```
