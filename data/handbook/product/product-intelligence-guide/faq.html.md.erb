## FAQ

### Why can't I find new Snowplow tracking events in my staging environment?

Most SiSense models you can query do not include Snowplow tracking events from the staging environment. This ensures that all events you see are production events, and your dashboards and metrics are not skewed by staging events. Staging Snowplow events can be
queried from `prod.legacy.snowplow_staging_unnested_events_30` table. Example query:

```
select *
from prod.legacy.snowplow_staging_unnested_events_30
where collector_tstamp >= DATE('2022-03-20')
order by collector_tstamp desc
```

### Can I add aggregated metrics that use both Redis and database data sources?

It is not yet possible to add aggregated metrics due to differences in the implementation of the underlying algorithms for each of data sources. [Issue 357577](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357577) outlines the work required in order to add this feature.

### Where I can find queries used to build Automated Service Ping?

There is an API endpoint, see more details in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/usage_data.html#export-service-ping-sql-queries)

### Do we need a feature flag for Service Ping metrics stored in Redis?

[The feature flags for Redis HLL metrics are optional](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#add-new-events) and we recommend them to be used for performance reasons.

### How can I see new Service Ping values for GitLab.com in Sisense?

The [Copy query to clipboard feature](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#metrics-dictionary-features) from [Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/), generates the query ready to be run in Sisense.

### Why is my metric returning a negative number?

We use [fallback values](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/implement.html#fallback-values-for-service-ping), which contains negative numbers for specific use cases.

### What is the difference between `original_metric_value` and `monthly_metric_value`?

- `monthly_metric_value` is a calculated field for all-time counters. The calculation is in [prep_monthly_usage_data_all_time](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.prep_monthly_usage_data_all_time). 
     - `last_ping_value` which is utilized in the `monthly_metric_value` calculation,is â€œvalue from the last ping of the previous month".
- `original_metric_value` is the value returned in the service ping payload.

### Which tooling should I use when instrumenting metrics/events?

Checkout out the [Getting started with Product Intelligence](/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/getting-started/).

### How do I manually upload a Service Ping payload?

You can use the [VersionApp UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/usage_statistics.html#manually-upload-service-ping-payload) to manually upload a Service Ping payload.
