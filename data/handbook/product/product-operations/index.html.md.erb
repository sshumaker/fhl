## Product operations direction

You can learn about what Product Operations is at GitLab, how it works and the areas of focus [here](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/product-operations/).

## Product operations board

You can collaborate or contribute to any work in progress with the Product Operations team by following the product operations [issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/boards/3651029?label_name[]=Product%20Operations) or [epic board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epic_boards/11131?label_name[]=Product%20Operations).  

## Product operations releases

Product operations work happens in alignment with GitLab's [product development timeline](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#product-development-timeline), releasing on the 22nd of every month. However, in order to avoid overlap with the product release peak work time and allow teams the bandwidth to understand and adopt updates into their workflow, product operations release notes will push between the 23rd and 30th of every month, and be adjusted as needed around holidays and weekends.
