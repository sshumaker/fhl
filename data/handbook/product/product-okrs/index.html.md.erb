## Product Division OKR Overview

For an overview of our overall approach to OKRs, as well as any company-wide OKR due dates, visit [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/). 

### General timeline and process

### Guidance on timeline and process

This page provides an overview of the Product Division OKR workflow. All departments (product management, UX, etc.) collaborate by following this guidance. For clarifications on the OKR process, team members can post in Slack #product and tag [Product Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/#fseifoddini). Team members can also attend [Product Operations office hours](/handbook/product/product-processes/#product-operations-office-hours-bi-weekly) for live support. Every quarter, there will also be a feedback issue linked on this page as part of the current quarter references that anyone can contribute to. 

## Timeline and process for every quarter

## Updating the Status and Progress of OKRs 

**When to update the status of Product OKRs** 

- For all Product team OKRs, the KR owners are responsible for keeping the status of their KRs in [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#how-to-use-gitlab-for-okrs) up to date
     - Team members who **own** specific OKRs will update [the score (% complete) in GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs) monthly and ping any relevant stakeholders as needed. For example, since FY23-Q1 begins February 1, KR owners will provide score updates by February 15,  March 15 and April 15. We follow this mid-month cycle to ensure there are accurate OKR status updates for [Key Reviews](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/key-review/) which typically happen around the 20th of each month.
- **Owners** of KRs will get pinged with reminders to do "check-ins" via Slack around the 5th of each month.
- **Owners** of KRs will also get pinged in the [Product Key Review issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/2919) as needed to update the Product Key Review slides around the 18th of each month based on what is in GitLab.

**How to report progress of Product OKRs**

- Prior to the start of each quarter, shared product KR owners should lead and align on a plan for the [Product Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#quad--infra--security-product-group-dris) to accomplish their KRs.
- For guidance on how to structure and score OKRs, refer to the Scoring OKRs section on the GitLab OKRs page (https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/#scoring-okrs).

**How this will look in Product Key Review slides**

- Product Key Reviews will reference Ally.io in an [OKR specific slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5Kc1kpJJBm5aJFT24V05xuR3pHjCGzID-QkYcUSZ5k/edit#slide=id.ge7a2c8f4b9_0_12)
- Product team OKR owners may leverage this [slide template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O5Kc1kpJJBm5aJFT24V05xuR3pHjCGzID-QkYcUSZ5k/edit#slide=id.geb1b1c60d1_1_4) if additional details are needed for their KRs

## How to write OKRs

It is highly recommended that product groups limit the number of OKRs they commit to so they have reasonable bandwidth to deliver  on them. PMs should consider either setting 1 OKR that's not related to a product theme **OR** 3 or fewer KRs if they are using the product themes as their objectives.

Here's are some examples of  how GPMs and PMs can use  epics/issues to plan and outline their product group OKRs:

- [Create stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12875)

     - [Create: Editor group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/12044)

     - [Create: Code review group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/-/issues/12877)

- Manage stage

     - [Compliance group](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/334921)

[Verify stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/verify-stage/-/issues/89)
