The UX Department works alongside the community, Product Managers (PMs), Frontend engineers (FE), Backend engineers (BE), and the Brand team. PMs are responsible for kicking off initiatives and setting the product direction. PMs define the "what" and "why" for feature-related issues by gathering customer and user feedback, and they give GitLab team members and the wider community space to suggest and create.

UX should assist in driving the [product vision](/direction/) early in the process. We inform the vision by conducting [foundational research](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/foundational-research/) and facilitating discussions with community members, customers, PM, FE, and BE. We are **elevated** above just the transactional workflow and **generative** in creating work, rather than just executing tasks. We align with the Brand team's direction for GitLab and incorporate brand standards and "brand moments" into the product when appropriate.

## UX Workflows

* [UX Department](/handbook/product/ux/ux-department-workflow/)
* [Product Designer workflows](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/)
* [UX Researcher workflows](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/)
* [Technical Writing workflows](/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/workflow/)
* [Product Design Manager workflows](/handbook/product/ux/product-design/product-design-manager.html)

## UX team mission

Our mission is to collaborate with the wider GitLab community and fellow GitLab team members to rapidly create products and experiences that customers value over competitor products and toolchains. To achieve our mission, we commit ourselves to being:

* **Innovative** - We create [disruptive innovation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/01/25/what-disruptive-innovation-means) through GitLab's unified, feature-complete solution by replacing disconnected toolchains with streamlined solutions and seamless experiences.
* **Informative** - We partner with Product Management to conduct the rapid research and prototyping required for evidence-based planning, innovation, design, and delivery.
* **Efficient** - We generate more value, faster through conventional “boring” solutions, Lean UX, and design reuse (like our Design System, Pajamas).
* **Results focused** - We focus on rapid, continual delivery of customer results (not designs and docs).
* **Collaborative** - We design in the open and foster collaboration, so GitLab team members and the wider GitLab community can improve strategies and solutions end to end.

## Everyone can contribute

The UX department is not solely responsible for the user experience of GitLab. Everyone is encouraged to contribute their thoughts on how we can make GitLab better by opening an issue. You can use just words or include images. These images can take a variety of forms; here are just a few examples:

* Drawings or sketches to convey your idea
* Wireframes made using a software of your choosing (Balsamiq, Sketch, etc.)
* High-fidelity mockups made using the [Pajamas Design System][pajamas]
* Screenshots of changes to our UI, made by manipulating the DOM in the browser

If you are creating high-fidelity designs, please make sure to let others know that this is a proposal and needs UX review. You can ping anyone on the UX team for assistance. Use the [design and UI changes checklist](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/design.html#checklist) to help you think through how your design will read, look, and behave.

## Competitor discussion

Anyone discussing or sharing information about competitors in public must follow our [Public Discussion of Competitor Products Guidelines](/handbook/legal/competitor-discussion-guidelines/).

## Proactive and reactive UX

We'll always have responsibility for reactive tasks that help "keep the lights on," such as bug fixes and minor UX enhancements. But we also must carve out some portion of our time for proactive work that identifies existing pain points, redefines how we approach problems, and uncovers actionable innovation and improvement opportunities. This proactive UX work enables us to create the most complete, competitive, and resilient solutions.

It isn’t always easy to find the space for proactive UX work, but the challenge is worth it, because it's how we create a best-in-class product experience. And it's not just the UX team's responsibility; it requires a coordinated effort from Leadership, Product, and Engineering, too.

We're currently working to find the right balance between proactive and reactive UX work. While we don't have a prescriptive ratio, we also don't allot 100% of our available work time to reactive efforts. Before and at the start of each milestone, UXers should work with their managers to define the appropriate ratio, based on our active OKRs and stage group requirements. When there are questions about priority or scope, or when a UXer is concerned about meeting a deadline, they should immediately reach out to their manager to help them resolve any concerns. Comunicate early and often!

### Examples of proactive UX

One example of proactive UX work is our [UX Scorecards](/handbook/product/ux/ux-scorecards/) initiative. Another example is the foundational research that our UX Researchers lead (while inviting cross-functional partners to participate). Yet another example is the ongoing effort to [beautify our UI](/handbook/product/ux/product-design/#beautifying-our-ui), both through [small, tactical changes](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/989) and through our [Pajamas Design System][pajamas].

**UX Scorecards** <br>
Designers use [UX Scorecards](/handbook/product/ux/ux-scorecards/) to benchmark common user tasks. In many cases, tasks involve multiple stages of the product, giving designers visibility into how users traverse across stages. Designers follow with [Experience Recommendations](/handbook/product/ux/ux-scorecards/) for how to improve the experience in upcoming milestones.

## Iteration

Here at GitLab, iteration means making the [smallest thing that adds value and getting it out as quickly as possible](/handbook/values/#iteration). Working like this allows us to reduce cycle time and get feedback from users faster, so we can continue to improve quickly and efficiently.

Iteration isn't just one of GitLab’s six founding values, [C.R.E.D.I.T](/handbook/values/#credit), it is one of the [foundational concepts in design thinking and user experience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-iteration-brings-powerful-results-so-do-it-again-designer). Planning too far ahead without real-world feedback can cause you to build something that doesn't meet user needs.

Iteration is especially vital in an open-source community. Keeping changes small and iterative makes it easy for anyone to contribute. Here are some examples of how we are embracing the power of iteration and using it to build GitLab:

* We aggressively break issues down into the smallest scope possible. If an effort is too big to be developed in one milestone, then it is too big. [Epics](/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics) allow us to maintain a holistic view of an area, while breaking the work down into an MVC.
* We keep a list of improvement issues that are actively seeking contributions from the community. They are small in scope, allowing the community to contribute designs or code to the issues. You can learn more about it in the [Community Contributions](/handbook/product/ux/ux-department-workflow/#community-contributions) section of this handbook. You can also [view the list of issues that need UX work](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?state=opened&label_name[]=Accepting+merge+requests&label_name[]=UX).
* You may notice that our [Design System](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com) has a lot of "to-do" items. Rather than try to tackle everything at once, we are gradually populating our component library and incrementally rolling those components out to production.

## Pair Designing

Pair Designing gives Product Designers a consistent partner to ideate with at the beginning of an effort and get feedback from during the design process, and conduct [design reviews](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#design-reviews). It also gives Product Designers exposure to product areas outside of their own.

* New designer pairs are connected every six months.
* Pairing assignments should comprise designers from different stages (e.g., a Plan designer should pair with someone outside of the Plan stage).
* If we have an odd number of designers, we'll have one 3-person partnership.
* Pairs decide what to share and when; there is no pre-defined schedule or guidelines.
* It's imperative to ask for feedback and give context.

See the [Design Pair Rotation](./design-pair-rotation/) list.

## Stable counterparts

Every Product Designer is aligned with a PM and is responsible for the same features their PM oversees.
Technical Writers each support multiple stage groups. UX Researchers support multiple PMs within a section.

UXers work alongside PMs and engineering at each phase of the process: planning, discovery, implementation, and further iteration. The area a Product Designer or Technical Writer is responsible for is part of their title; for example, "Product Designer, Plan."

### Headcount planning

In the spirit of having "stable counterparts," we plan headcount as follows:

* **One Product Designer for every stage group**
    * 1:1 ratio of Product Designers to Product Managers (excludes stage groups with no UI impact or, in some cases, stage groups with low usage)
    * 1 Product Designer:1-3 Frontend Engineers; 2 Product Designers:4-5 Frontend Engineers
* **One Technical Writer for up to three stage groups**
    * 1:3 ratio of Technical Writers to stage groups
    * Approximately a 1:21 ratio of Technical Writers to Engineers
* **One UX Researcher for up to 5 stage groups**
    * 1:5 ratio of UX Researchers to Product Managers
    * Approximately a 1:35 ratio of UX Researchers to Engineers
* **Manager support that's appropriate for the function**
    * Approximately a 1:5 ratio of Managers to direct reports for UX Research and Product Design
    * Approximately a 1:7 ratio of Managers to direct reports for Technical Writing

## Time off

Taking [time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/) is important. It is equally important to come back to work and feel refreshed. We discourage team members from checking work-related activities while on leave as a way of feeling less overwhelmed when returning. To prevent this, your stage design peers, or manager if you do not have stage design peers, will serve as your backup when you are on PTO (paid time off) by:

* Providing a touch point for Product and Engineering to ask UX questions related to your stage group.
* Unblocking an issue or merge request when possible.
* Delegating work to others on the team.
* Communicating blocking issues or merge requests with the report when they return if it was not possible to resolve or delegate while they were away.

Backups are responsible for addressing critical UX work while a designer is away. Critical UX work is defined as any work that addresses an outage, a broken feature with no workaround, or the current workaround is unacceptable. If a backup begins to feel overwhelmed with workload, they should immediately reach out to their manager for help. Your manager will be able to help further delegate tasks when necessary.

When taking time off, be sure to [communicate it with other people](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off).

When returning to work, you are not responsible for responding to every To Do that accrued while you were away. Utilizing a tool such as [PTO Tanuki](https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/pto-tanuki) helps reduce outdated mentions upon returning.

### Coverage during time off

No matter how much time off you are taking: Always use [PTO by Deel](/handbook/paid-time-off/#pto-by-deel) to set a role for your backup person during your PTO, and add the [UX Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_9psh26fha3e4mvhlrefusb619k%40group.calendar.google.com) (_internal only_) to your settings (its calendar ID is in the Google Calendar settings), so your PTO events are visible to everyone in the department.

**If you are taking at least 1 week off:** In the GitLab Design project, open a new issue using the [UX Coverage template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/UX%20Coverage.md) and list the priorities and issues that the responsible backups need to cover while you are on PTO.

_This section applies to Product Design and UX Research. For Technical Writing, read [Technical Writer PTO](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#technical-writer-pto)._

* Make sure to open your UX Coverage issue at least one week ahead of the scheduled PTO to effectively evaluate the scope of the open tasks and align on the items for coverage with your backup person. Fill in the coverage issue with all relevant information before assigning/requesting a backup, so that people can assess the complexity of the tasks and their availability to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
* Make sure to align with your Product and Engineering Managers that no new features design work will be scheduled during your PTO time. The backup person is only covering for urgent needs, such as reviewing MRs that are in development during the milestone, providing feedback to general questions that already have a design proposal established and replying to Slack questions, etc.
* When leaving on PTO, make sure that the more significant design discussions are closed. This way the backup person can avoid spending lots of time on finding a SSOT and collecting historical data around the request that will lead to blocking the team.

**When taking an extended time off**, such as [Parental Leave](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#parental-leave): Work with your manager to communicate with the relevant stable counterparts to ensure that UX workload for that stage is reduced in order to avoid burnout among other designers on the team. We do not expect designers to increase their capacity during your time off.

## UX Transition

When responsibility for an individual stage, group, or category changes, we use the [UX Transition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/new?issuable_template=UX%20Transition) issue template to provide a stable and consistent handoff among UX department team members.

## UX Calendar

The [UX Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gitlab.com_9psh26fha3e4mvhlrefusb619k%40group.calendar.google.com) (_internal only_) is the SSOT for our team meetings. You can find the details for the UX Department weekly calls, Group Conversations, UX Showcase, and other team meetings here. These meetings are open to everyone in GitLab. Anyone in the UX department can add events to the Google Calendar. Managers and above can make changes and manage sharing, while ICs can make changes to events. Please reach out in the `#ux_leadership` Slack channel with any questions or requests.


## Collaboration model

We believe that strong cross-functional collaboration between Product, UX, Development, and Quality leads to the most successful products.

These roles should be well balanced, so that each group can contribute to the product and make informed decisions about what to build and how to build it. Collaboration enables us to build features that are desirable, usable, and feasible. It also helps GitLab to achieve business goals, delight users, and build software that's high quality, fast, and secure.

There are three essential parts to great collaboration: shared processes, appropriate tools, and psychological safety.

### Collaboration essential 1: Shared process
We follow GitLab's shared process referred to as the [Product Development Flow](/handbook/product-development-flow/).

UX research and design are essential componenents throughout the Product Development Flow. Talking to customers or potential customers to understand their problems is at the core of this idea.

### Collaboration essential 2: Collaboration tools
We have a lot of collaboration tools available to us at GitLab. It's our responsibility to select the best communication medium for the situation and to understand when and how to use our tools. Zapier, another all remote company, wrote [an article about collaboration tools and methods](https://zapier.com/blog/remote-design-culture/) that help foster communication among remote teams.

#### Asynchronous communication is best for:
- Understanding ideas and plans
- Documenting work, decisions, conversations
- Discussions with straightforward outcomes that can be resolved in three back and forth interactions or fewer

#### Synchronous communication is best for:
- Getting to know people
- Visual thinking
- Complex discussions that require back and forth conversation

| Asynchronous | Flexi-synchronous  | Synchronous
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| - GitLab: Issues and MRs <br> - Figma: Wireframes and Prototypes <br> - Google: Email | - Zoom: Recorded meetings and screenshares <br> - Google Drive: Collaborative Documents <br> - Slack: Group Chat | - Zoom: Live meetings (1:1s and coffee chats) <br> - GitLab Contribute: In-person |

### Collaboration essential 3: Psychological safety and trust
People thrive in environments where they can bring their unique perspectives to work, put ideas forward without fear, and openly debate and critique ideas in a healthy and productive way. Read more about [Trust on Teams](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-spent-years-studying-effective-teams-this-single-quality-contributed-most-to-their-success.html) and why it matters.

### When to collaborate
The remote and asynchronous way we work can make it hard to know when collaboration is needed. Here are some things to think about:

- Keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of synchronous and asynchronous communication. There is a time for both, and using the right one for the job you are doing is an important way for you to be a leader and set a great example for team collaboration.
- Adding collaboration never hurts, so if in doubt, just reach out to someone on your team and chat with them about an idea, a user problem, or your design work.
- Let your product manager know you would like to be included in planning conversations. If you know early what the PM is thinking about working on, you can involve the research team early in the process.
- Product Designers will collaborate with PMs on issues during all tracks of work (Problem Validation, Solution Validation and Build). However, issues should be assigned directly to the Product Designer when it is within their scope of responsibility to do the UX work required to design or test a solution. This generally means that Problem Validation is complete and the user stories/requirements are defined well enough for the designer to make progress on a solution. Product Designers are also responsible for moving an issue through the UX workflow and assigning a `UX ready` label when the work is ready for the Build track. Just before UX Ready is a great time for PM, UX, and Engineering to sync up a final time to make sure the issue is indeed ready for development. Learn more about how we use Workflow labels in the [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/issue_workflow.html).
- Collaborate in a way that is sufficient for the type of project you are working on. For example:
	- **A completely new feature** will require a high level of collaboration, including synchronous time to brainstorm, sketch, and debate. The user research team should be involved. The bigger or riskier the feature, the more questions you should ask the PM.
	- **When making a major change to an existing experience**, it's important to talk to a lot of people (including customers, product, engineering, and support) to gather the full context and understand the impact your changes will have.
	- **When adding depth to a feature**, collaborate with the entire team during user research to carefully decide which features will be the most valuable. Also, engage your cross-functional team to determine how to add features in a way that keeps the rest of the product usable and useful to customers.

The beginning of an epic is a good time to talk through the big picture with the product manager and rest of the team as often as possible. Visuals like journey maps and screen or user flows can help keep everyone on the same page and make these discussions richer.

Remember:

- **Ask great questions.** Product Designers design best when they understand the reasons behind the features they work on. Ask your PM things like why this particular feature has value, why it's a priority over something else, what goals they are trying to accomplish, and so on.
- **Ask for help.** When you're working on something that feels especially ambiguous or tricky, or if you are struggling to select one of multiple options, this is a signal for you to collaborate. Bring in UX Research, PM, and/or Engineering for a discussion.
- **Frequently review design ideas with Product Managers and Engineers *before* they are finalized.** If the first time your cross-functional partners see a design is when it includes high-fidelity assets or specs, *that's too late*.
- **Engage your team in research.** Usability testing is another great time to collaborate. Invite team members to watch sessions and attend research reviews.
- **Invite peers into your process.** Some UX and PM tasks overlap, and individual skills vary quite a bit. Keep communication open, and talk about who is doing what. Some PMs like to do a little design work, and some UXers enjoy product strategy. This is always a good thing. With good communication, you both can work to your strengths without stepping on toes.
- **Advocate for great UX.** Consider asking your PM to allocate time each sprint to "customer delight" related stories. This could be a percentage, a point count, or whatever else works. This is a way to keep the focus on customer experience and delight, even when other priorities start to push in.

## Review, test, and contribute

There are several methods for you to review, test, and contribute changes to the app, user documentation, Pajamas, GitLab UI or company handbook.

We [encourage MR authors to add screenshots or videos](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html)
of their changes. However as they don’t cover all review aspects (for example, hover states, small viewports, accessibility, and so on.), you cannot rely on them exclusively and should always review the MR in a live environment.

The most common methods to review the MR in a live environment are:

- **Gitpod** ([Get started](#gitpod) and [Help](#help)): Pre-configured cloud environment
  that quickly provides a clean and immediately usable app, by just clicking on
  a link. Can be used to run GitLab instances (using GDK, see below), user documentation,
  Pajamas, or company handbook.
- **GitLab Development Kit (GDK)** ([Get started](#gdk) and [Help](#help)):
  It's how we install and maintain GitLab instances on our local machines.
  However, some technical knowledge is needed, its speed depends on your local
  machine, and it’s quite easy for the GDK to become “broken” when it's updated.
- **Review Apps** ([Get started](#review-apps)):
  Unique links specifically created for each MR to preview their changes. Ideal
  for documentation changes (Pajamas or company handbook). Unfortunately,
  previewing a GitLab instance is very limited compared to other methods
  ([improvements epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6660)).
- **Sync with author**: Although we have a [bias towards asynchronous communication](/handbook/values/#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication),
  sometimes it's more productive to have a one-on-one sync with the MR author.
  Can be especially helpful if changes are hard to test or reproduce.

### Contributing

GitLab is a complex platform that helps teams shorten cycle times, reduce costs, stregthen security, and increase developer productivity. In order to make the DevOps lifecycle more approachable for all users, it is essential that each member of the Product Design department has general knowledge of Git and DevOps flows by frequently using the various features across the product.

The Product Design department builds confidence in these areas by using the product in a live environment and contributing small fixes to the various projects that make up GitLab, including the app, user documentation, Pajamas, and GitLab UI. Designers are not expected to be full stack developers, but we do expect designers to grow their basic development skills to build empathy and understanding for the workflows our users experience on a daily basis.

Additionally, building these skills has the added benefit of empowering designers to directly make small, meaningful changes to the product. Migrating components or updating UI copy, for example, improves the consistency, visual design, and accessibility of the app.

### Get started

We encourage you to read the most up-to-date documentation links below, but
if you're more of a visual person, fear not! Check out the [GDK and Gitpod walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KqrLsB8wlEhl2F9hXZlMmNR)

- [How to enable Feature Flags in Review Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBo667LiwBQ)

You can enable a feature flag by sending an API request to the review app in your local environment, or using a browser API request tool such as [Reqbin](https://reqbin.com/).

To enable a feature flag using Reqbin, follow these steps:

- Open the user settings in the review app and create an API access token in access tokens
- Open [Reqbin](https://reqbin.com/)
- Copy and paste the token you created to the authorization field
- Copy and paste the review app URL to the URL field, followed by `api/v4/features/:feature_name`
- Select a POST request
- Set content of the request to `{"value": true}`
- If the request is sent correctly, you can go back to the review app and the feature flag should be on

### Help!

If you get stuck using any of these methods, follow the tips below in order. Don't
struggle on your own and, when in doubt, ping a UX member to facilitate finding
the right help.

1. If using GDK (locally or in Gitpod), first try to [troubleshoot it yourself](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/-/blob/main/doc/troubleshooting.md),
   but don't hesitate to reach out for help (see points below) when you're unsure
   about the problem.
1. **Gitpod**

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
In FY23-Q2, we are piloting a Root Cause Analysis on 5 design projects to help drive insights about our design processes. Product Designers have the clearest view about "how we work" when it comes to design quality, so our goal is to understand their perspective on what's working well and where the team may need additional unblocking or support.

To ensure that we capture information from across the entire Product Design sub-department, each Product Design Manager will select one project from within their area of coverage to conduct an RCA. We will follow the [blameless RCA guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/handbook/engineering/root-cause-analysis) outlined in the Engineering handbook with minor modifications to the template to fit our needs. Because this is a pilot, we will evaluate the effectiveness of the effort at the end of Q2 to determine: (1) whether it was useful and worth continuing and (2) whether the process needs additional modifications.

Our RCAs are located in the [UX RCA project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-ux/ux-rca). When preparing for an RCA, an issue is created using the [UX RCA template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-ux/ux-rca/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/root_cause_analysis.md).
