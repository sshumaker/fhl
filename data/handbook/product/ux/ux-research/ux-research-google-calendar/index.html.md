We use the shared [UX Research Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/2?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV9raWVxdjk2ajM1bXB0OGJka2Nicml1MnFiZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) (link is only available to GitLab employees) to advertise upcoming problem validation and solution validation research efforts. UX Researchers, Product Designers, and Product Managers can add events to this calendar. These invites are only viewable by GitLab employees. Your participant will see and use the original Calendly invite.
