The GitLab Technical Writing team collaborates with developers, product managers, and the community to develop product documentation.

Good documentation meets the evolving needs of all GitLab customers, users, and administrators. It educates readers about features and best practices. It enables people to efficiently configure, use, and troubleshoot GitLab. The Technical Writing team manages the [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com) site and its content, processes, and tooling.

The [documentation roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/foundations/gitlab_docs/) and [related epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4602) drive our efforts to improve both the content and [documentation website](https://docs.gitlab.com/). For example, we know that people have trouble finding information on docs.gitlab.com. We have roadmap items to better organize the documentation content, improve the information architecture, and upgrade the search capabilities. These larger projects, completed in addition to feature documentation, provide continual, iterative improvement to the user experience of our documentation.

Anyone can contribute to the documentation. Follow our [GitLab documentation guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/).

## Public Training for GitLab Technical Writing

If you're interested in updating or creating GitLab product documentation, see our [Technical Writing Fundamentals course](fundamentals/), which includes:
- Guidelines for technical writing.
- GitLab style conventions.
- Information about internal testing.
- Instructions for content types.

## Responsibilities

Team members are [assigned](#assignments) to specific DevOps stage groups. The Technical Writing team is broadly responsible for both developing documentation content and UI text, and helping others while they develop content:

- Maintaining documentation for many engineering projects.
- Occasionally developing new content to meet the needs of the community.
- Reviewing and collaborating on documentation plans, reviewing doc merge requests or recently merged docs, and ensuring that content meets style and language standards.
- Reorganizing, revamping, and authoring improved documentation to ensure completeness and a smooth user experience.
- Collaborating with Product Designers on UI text, such as microcopy, links from the UI to documentation, error messages, and UI element labels.
- Acting as Technical Writing Lead for the monthly [release post](../../../marketing/blog/release-posts/).

### Prioritization

When evaluating work to meet our stakeholders' needs, we prioritize in the following order:

1. Feature work (including documenting new features, and providing guidance on UI text)
1. OKR-related work
1. Backlog issues (including docs technical debt and implementing content topic design)
1. All other tasks (including creating suggestion- or warning-level [Vale rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/testing.html#vale-result-types))

### Processes

The team is responsible for developing and maintaining efficient processes, including:

- Ensuring that processes are in place and being followed to keep the GitLab docs up to date.
- Following and optimizing documentation workflows with Product and Engineering, Documentation Team workflows, and the division of work.
- Triaging doc-related issues.
- Refining the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/index.html) and continuously improving content about GitLab documentation and its contribution process.
- Making it easier for anyone to contribute to the documentation while efficiently handling community contributions to docs.

#### Style Guide

The [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/)
provides language and style guidance for the product documentation and release posts.

Any Technical Writer (or other contributor) can make suggestions for
documentation style updates or additions by creating an issue or merge request with the
`~tw-style` label, and then assigning the issue or MR to the Style Guide DRI. GitLab team members can also use the #docs Slack channel.

Use the following searches to track completed style-related issues:

- [GitLab project style issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)
- [GitLab project style MRs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)
- [Technical Writing project style issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=tw-style)

#### Testing

The Technical Writing team develops and maintains toolkits to test GitLab's documentation (and other technical content) for problems. These toolkits include (but aren't limited) to:

- Text content and writing style: markdownlint, Vale
- Text formatting: Markdownlint, yamllint
- Link validity: nanoc
- File permissions and naming: `lint-doc.sh`

Any contributor can suggest changes to our linting rules or tooling by creating an issue or merge request with the [`~tw-testing`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?label_name[]=tw-testing) label, and then assigning the issue or MR to a technical writer.

#### Translation and internationalization

Everyone can contribute to the translation of GitLab from English into other languages.
To learn more about translation and internationalization at GitLab, visit the Import and Manage stage Category Direction page on [Internationalization](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/manage/internationalization/).
For a step-by-step guide to translation contributions, read [Translating GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/i18n/translation.html).

The [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/) site is not included in the community efforts to internationalize GitLab. Discussion on translating documentation into other languages is included in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15471#note_214823504).

## Assignments

Technical Writers (TWs) collaborate with other teams and
groups as described on the [DevOps stages](#designated-technical-writers),
[Development Guidelines](#assignments-to-development-guidelines), and
[other subjects](#assignments-to-other-projects-and-subjects) sections below.

### Assignments to DevOps Stages and Groups
{: #designated-technical-writers}

**If you were directed here from a documentation page's metadata:**
References to stages and groups in documentation metadata don't indicate developer group ownership, but instead help connect people to the assigned stable counterpart technical writer with subject matter awareness.
If internal groups want to use other metadata parameters to track information in documentation pages, please create an issue in the Technical Writing repository for discussion.
Additional discussions are in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/547).
{: .alert .alert-info}

The designated Technical Writer is the go-to person for their assigned
[stage groups](/handbook/product/categories/). They collaborate with
other team members to plan new documentation, edit existing documentation,
review any proposed changes to documentation, suggest changes to the microcopy
exposed to users, and generally partner with subject matter experts (SMEs) in
all situations where documentation is required.

When a Technical Writer [is on PTO](#technical-writer-pto), the whole team acts as their backup.

**Note:** If you've been directed here from metadata in a documentation page
that has `none` as the stage, refer to the
[Assignments to other projects and subjects](#assignments-to-other-projects-and-subjects)
section, referencing the group shown in metadata with the listed Subjects in the table.

Not sure who's responsible for a feature? Review feature assignments by [stage](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) or [group](/handbook/product/categories/features/).
{: .alert .alert-info}

<%= partial("includes/stages/tech-writing") %>

<!--
  To update the table above:

  - For tech writer's name per stage, change data/stages.yml and includes/stages/tech-writing.html.haml
  - To turn off a stage, set tw: false in data/stages.yml

Reference: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/24952
-->

Technical Writers are encouraged to review and improve documentation of other
stages but they aren't required to. When contributing to docs they don't own,
they must respect the assigned TW's ownership and ensure to request their review
and approval when adding significant changes to their docs.

### Assignments to development guidelines

As GitLab grows, it's important to ensure that the
guidelines for contributors are consistent and aligned throughout the organization.
Development guidelines consist of:

- GitLab [development guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/):
  The processes and technical information needed for contributing to GitLab. Use
  the [development guidelines review process](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/development_processes.html#development-guidelines-review)
  for any changes or updates to documentation in the `/development` directory.
- [GitLab Design System ("Pajamas")](https://design.gitlab.com/): The entire content of
  [`contents`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-services/design.gitlab.com/-/tree/main/contents)
  must be reviewed and approved by the TW assigned to Development Guidelines.
- [GitLab UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ui/): Documentation in this
  project doesn't require TW review. The TW for Dev Guidelines will help in
  creating and maintaining minimum requirements for this documentation through
  specific guidelines and templates, and assist the team on request.

For merge request reviews:

- If you belong to one of the stage groups, request a review from the Technical Writer assigned to your group.
- If you don't belong to a group that has a Technical Writer assigned, spin the [reviewer roulette](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?sortKey=stats.avg7&order=-1&hourFormat24=true&visible=maintainer%7Cdocs)
  to determine a Technical Writer to request review from.
- Technical Writers provide a lighter level of editing on Developer Guideline pages than on user-facing docs.
- For [minor fixes and typos](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/#wording-style-or-link-changes),
  any GitLab Maintainer can review and merge your merge request.
- If you need guidance on development guidelines, you can request help or input from the [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C16HYA2P5) Slack channel
  or the development guidelines' DRI.

## Docs site stats

The technical writing team supports a large amount of content.

The number of pages in the four primary repositories (GitLab, Omnibus, Charts, and Runner):

| Date          | # of pages |
|---------------|------------|
| May 2020      | 1,165      |
| Jan 2022      | 1,562      |
| June 2022     | 1,633      |
| Sept 2022     | 1,785      |
| Dec 2022      | 1,840      |

**Change between May 2020 and Dec 2022:** 675 more pages (a 58% increase)

The number of words in these repositories:

| Date          | Word count |
|---------------|------------|
| May 2020      | 1,190,371  |
| Jan 2022      | 2,017,183  |
| June 2022     | 2,166,052  |
| Oct 2022      | 2,271,350  |
| Dec 2022      | 2,397,335  |

**Change between May 2020 and Dec 2022:** 1,206,964 more words

The word count has more than doubled in this timeframe.

## Technical Writer PTO

When Technical Writers take [paid time off](/handbook/paid-time-off/), the rest of the team provides coverage for them.
These team members may require additional context for requests. Requests are incorporated into the list of stage/group and
feature priorities for *their* primary groups.

Options for groups to get help when an assigned Technical Writer is on PTO are:

- [Reviewer Roulette](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?sortKey=stats.avg7&order=-1&visible=maintainer%7Cdocs).
  A rouletted Technical Writer can be pinged or assigned to an issue or merge request.
- A request in the [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/C16HYA2P5) channel in Slack, where it will be picked
  up by an available volunteer Technical Writer.
- For help with a specific, time-sensitive, in-progress piece of work, a pre-arranged Technical Writer. The Technical
  Writer can be pinged on issues or merge requests and begin participating.

If taking extended PTO (more than one week), Technical Writer should consider using the Technical Writer
[coverage issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/TW_Coverage.md).
This issue can describe exactly who is providing coverage, for what, and by what means.

### Taking PTO

When taking PTO, Technical Writers:

1. Ensure their [out-of-office messaging](/handbook/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off) reflects the available mechanisms for coverage.
   It's important to keep GitLab.com statuses up-to-date to ensure:

   - [Reviewer Roulette](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?sortKey=stats.avg7&order=-1&visible=maintainer%7Cdocs) can make accurate suggestions.
   - The TW team can easily see the PTO status of all team members when checking the Roulette dashboard.
1. Send a message in the group Slack channels indicating where to find the available mechanisms. For example:

   ```
   I’m off for the holidays (202y-mm-dd - 202y-mm-dd). For help with documentation while I'm away, see
   https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/technical-writing/#technical-writer-pto for ways to get help.
   For urgent _named time-sensitive task_ matters, ping _named TW_.
   ```

### Merge request queue checks

Before a Technical Writer goes on PTO, the writer or their manager should determine who will check the writer's MR queue. The assigned person should check the queue at least once each day in the [GitLab Review Workload Dashboard](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?sortKey=stats.avg30&mode=show&order=-1&hourFormat24=true&visible=maintainer%7Cdocs).

The assigned writer does not need to do the work. When they check the queue, they can:

- Assign the MRs to themselves for review.
- Use Roulette to find other TWs to review.

## Regularly scheduled tasks

Along with Technical Writers' normally assigned work, there are recurring tasks
that need to be regularly completed:

- **Release Post Structural Check:** The Technical Writing Lead [reviews the content](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#tw-lead) for the release post published at the end of each milestone. See the [Release Post Scheduling](/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/) Handbook page for each milestone's assigned writer.
- **Monthly doc version:** At the end of each milestone, a Technical Writer [creates the monthly version for the docs site](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md). The Technical Writer assigned to this task is the writer who completed the release post structural check for the previous milestone.
- **Docs project maintenance tasks:** Each month, one Technical Writer is assigned to complete maintenance tasks for the documentation site and its content. This involves [creating a new issue using the `tw-monthly-tasks` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/new?issue[title]=Docs%20project%20maintenance%20tasks%2C%20Month%20YYYY&issuable_template=tw-monthly-tasks) in the `technical-writing` project to track maintenance work. If additional work beyond what's described in the maintenance issue is required, the Technical Writer creates merge requests and additional issues as needed.

Schedule for Docs project maintenance tasks:

- April, 2022: [Fiona Neill]
- May, 2022: [Marcin Sędłak-Jakubowski]
- June, 2022: [Axil]
- July, 2022: [Clayton Cornell]
- August, 2022: [Russell Dickenson]
- September, 2022: [Amy Qualls]
- October, 2022: [Marcel Amirault]
- November, 2022: [Kati Paizee]
- December, 2022: [Diana Logan]
- January, 2023: [Phillip Wells]
- February, 2023: [Jon Glassman]
- March, 2023: [Marcin Sędłak-Jakubowski]

## Reviews

Technical Writers are assigned to review merge requests that contain documentation changes authored by GitLab team members and community contributors. The reviews are assigned by subject matter according to the [Technical Writer assignments](#assignments) to [stage groups](../../product/product-categories/#devops-stages) or other specialties.

### Levels of edit

The Technical Writers edit the documentation based on the following levels of edit:

**Light**

- Ensure the pipeline passes and no obvious grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors exist.

**Medium**

- Ensure the pipeline passes and no grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors exist.
- Ensure the content is clear, discoverable, navigable, and written with the user's perspective in mind.
- Ensure the content meets the guidelines in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/).

**Heavy**

- Ensure the pipeline passes and no grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors exist.
- Ensure the content is clear, discoverable, navigable, and written with the user's perspective in mind.
- Ensure the content meets the guidelines in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/).
- Ensure the content conforms to the defined [topic types](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/topic_types/).
- Ensure the content fits well into the larger documentation set and does not duplicate information in other areas.

#### How the writers apply the levels of edit

To balance quality, speed, and resource constraints, the technical writers apply different levels of edit to different documentation.

These guidelines are meant to provide general guidance. They aren't set in stone, and they can be overridden on a case-by-case basis.

These items receive a **light** edit:

- In the GitLab repository:
  - Blueprint documentation (everything in the `architecture/blueprints` directory)
  - Contribution guidelines (everything in the `development` directory)
- Documentation outside of the five main GitLab repositories (GitLab, Charts, Operator, Omnibus, and Runner)
- Deprecations and removals
- Merge requests authored by other technical writers, unless the MR is part of an OKR, or the author requests a more in-depth edit

These items receive a **medium** edit:

- Day-to-day product documentation requests:
  - New feature work (from [stage groups](../../categories/#devops-stages) or [Incubation engineers](../../../engineering/incubation/playbook/#quality--support-guidelines-for-incubation-projects))
  - Improvements
  - Bug fixes
  - Community contributions
- Release post items

These items receive a **heavy** edit:

- Topic type restructuring efforts (["CTRT"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/topic_types/))
- OKR work

In all cases, the Technical Writer confirms that an authoritative source has checked the documentation for technical accuracy.
The Technical Writer can serve as that authoritative source if they have the required knowledge or
can efficiently perform the necessary verification.

### Review workflow

To balance [velocity](/handbook/engineering/development/principles/#the-importance-of-velocity) and quality, the writers use this workflow:

- When a writer opens a merge request, another writer must review and merge. Peer reviews are important to maintain quality and help the team build a common voice.

- When anyone else (like a developer, community member, or Support team member) opens a merge request:
  - If the MR contains documentation and code, the writer adds suggestions but does not merge. The MR is merged by another developer.

  - If the MR contains documentation only:
    - Writers can apply small suggestions, by using the **Apply suggestion** feature, before they merge.
      Writers can fix things like missing punctuation, typos, and pipeline failures without additional review.
    - Writers do not push larger changes (by using suggestions or commits) to the author's branch unless they have explicit approval in the MR to do so.
      Pushing to a branch can cause hard-to-resolve merge conflicts, and content can be accidentally overwritten.
    - In rare cases, a writer has agreement from their team to make commits directly to the author's branch.
      In these cases, if the writer pushes changes other than minor typo fixes (by using suggestions or commits), the author
      must review before the writer merges. This workflow gives the MR
      author a chance to verify the changes and it helps ensure accuracy.

#### Triaging automated group mentions

When a bot or a community contributor mentions either `@gl-docsteam` or several Technical Writers based on CODEOWNERS, TWs should volunteer to:

1. Scan the MR and either volunteer to review it or determine which TW should review it, following the guidelines in [Selecting a reviewer](#selecting-a-reviewer).
1. Then, if the MR:
   - Seems ready for review, assign the selected TW as a reviewer.
   - Doesn't seem ready for review, leave a comment for the contributor asking them to mention the selected TW when they're ready.
1. Edit the bot's comment and format the team mention as code. For example: ``Hi `@gl-docsteam`! Please review this documentation merge request.`` This removes other TWs from the MR's participants list, and they will no longer receive notifications for it. The to-do notification will be updated to show the username in backticks, so team members working from their to-do list will have a visible hint that the MR has been addressed.

### Selecting a reviewer

In most cases, Technical Writers should use the [GitLab Review Workload Dashboard](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?sortKey=stats.avg7&order=-1&hourFormat24=true&visible=maintainer%7Cdocs) to identify someone for a technical writing review. Be sure the page's filter is set to show only Technical Writers and sort by **Assign events last 7 days**.

To get an available Technical Writer, select **Spin the wheel!** on the Dashboard page. In the specific cases where the selected Technical Writer already has a lot of assigned reviews or has recently been very busy, you can select **Spin the wheel!** again to get a different writer.

If you have content that needs a specific assignee, or if you have a merge request for a page that has a DRI (such as the Documentation Style Guide), in those cases you can specifically assign the review to that person.

### Determining Technical Writer availability

There are occasions when Technical Writers may be too busy for general team merge request reviews, and need to focus on their groups or other priorities. In those cases, Technical Writers can update their GitLab status by selecting the **Busy** checkbox and adding the 🔴 `:red_circle:`, which prevents their name from appearing in the reviewer roulette.

For example, Technical Writers on release duty for a milestone should add the busy indicator to their status for the week preceeding the 22nd of the month, to focus on release posts and other requirements.

In all other cases, while Technical Writers can add (and remove) the busy indicator from their profiles, we ask that the busy indicator be in place for no longer than two days at a time, and be employed no more than once every two weeks. (Noting that the use of the busy indicator during releases doesn't affect this.) If you need more time not participating in the review roulette, be sure to talk to your manager so they can help (which may include additional use of the busy indicator).

## Merge rights

The Technical Writing team is given merge rights (through
[Maintainer access](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-project-maintainer))
to GitLab projects as part of their role. Not all developers get Maintainer access. Technical
writers should use this privilege responsibly.

As Maintainers, Technical Writers should limit what they merge to:

- Documentation, typically in Markdown-formatted files.
- UI text, error messages, and link-related fixes, with the approvals of appropriate engineer(s).
- Documentation-related tooling and configuration such as linters, and changes
  to the [`gitlab-docs`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs) project. Engineers in the
  [Editor team](/handbook/engineering/development/dev/create/editor/) are
  available for code review and merges.

In addition, Technical Writers should:

- Never merge an MR with a failed pipeline, unless the failures are unrelated to the changes. If in
  doubt, ask an engineer.
- Ensure that MRs are complete before merging, with appropriate labels and milestones.
- Ensure that the DRI has reviewed and approved the MR.

## Onboarding Technical Writers

While the Technical Writer is onboarding, they will be assigned to
shadow groups and then start contributing as trainees. Veteran Technical Writers will coach them through the process.

### Group shadowing

For the first release cycle that begins after the new member starts at GitLab, they will shadow (read) their buddy's work in their most active
stage group, plus one other stage group/writer (decided with the
Technical Writing Manager). Veteran Technical Writers will
proactively share relevant issues, merge requests, and communications
with their shadows by using a `#tw-onboarding-<groupname>`
Slack channel, creating it if it doesn't already exist.

### Group trainees

For the second release cycle that begins after the new member's start, unless the shadowing phase is extended,
they will act as a trainee on one or more groups as assigned by the Manager.
The intent is to take on the group as its Technical Writer for the
next release. The veteran Technical Writer who is assigned to that Group
will assign substantial parts of the work to the new member,
which accounts to roughly half of the groups's reviews of MRs with docs, UI text,
and release post content; a small but substantial documentation
authoring project; and a few minor doc improvement projects/fixes.

### Group coaching

For the third release cycle, the onboarding Technical Writer assumes the
full role of Technical Writer for their assigned group, except that
they will not yet have [merge rights](#merge-rights). The former TW assigned to the group is now the coach,
who will review all their work (including reviews they perform of other authors)
before merging it or approving it for another maintainer to merge.
They may share the burden of these reviews with other Technical Writers.

## Standups
