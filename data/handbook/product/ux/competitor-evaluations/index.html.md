## What are competitor evaluations?

Competitor evaluations help us understand how a competing product addresses the Jobs-To-Be-Done that our product also tries to address. Competitor Evaluations are different from a competitor analysis, which compares business models and strategic positioning in the market (think SWOT analysis). During a competitor evaluation, we're evaluating solutions, not companies.

In some cases, a competing company may solve a narrower aspect of DevSecOps than GitLab. In contrast, another company might have a portfolio of solutions that add up to the full breadth of GitLab.
