## Overview

The features in the [Verify stage](/stages-devops-lifecycle/verify/) help users keep strict quality standards for production code by using automated testing and reporting. Delivery teams rely on the foundation provided by this stage as they fully embrace continuous development that automates builds, integration, and verification of their code while accelerating their team's velocity. Testing ranges from unit testing, load testing, all the way to accessibility and usability testing.

* Pipeline Authoring UX - _coming soon_
* Pipeline Insights _coming soon_ & [Runner UX](/handbook/product/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/runner/)


The Verify UX team is part of the [CI/CD UX team](/handbook/product/ux/stage-group-ux-strategy/ci-cd/). Our goal is to empower our customers by streamlining, expanding, and enabling increasingly complex configurations. We do so by providing the best management experience when setting up, configuring, or troubleshooting pipelines. Our design mission is to bring to the forefront simple ways to make GitLab the tool of choice for continuous integration users.

Our biggest partners are the stages under the CI/CD section ([Release](/direction/ops/#release) & [Package](/direction/ops/#package)), Dev ([Create](/direction/create/)), and Ops ([Configure](/direction/configure/)).

## Our Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
A Job to be Done ([JTBD](/handbook/product/ux/ux-resources/#jobs-to-be-done-jtbd)) is a framework, or lens, for viewing products and solutions in terms of the jobs customers are trying to achieve.

- [See all Verify stage JTBD](/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/#jobs-to-be-done-jtbd) 

## Shared UX

We divided the Verify stage into dedicated experience groups to align with a similar [split](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) undertaken by our engineering and PM counterparts. To deliver seamless user experiences, we share responsibility in the overall vision, goals, and research initiatives related to overlapping features. The UX teams work closely together and have shared coverage in the following areas:

- `gitlab-ci.yml`
- Pipelines
- Environment Variables
- Environments
- Merge requests
- Project settings
- User settings
- Instance-level settings
- Runner
- Audit logs
