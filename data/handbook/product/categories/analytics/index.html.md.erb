## What we cover

## Who we are



### Product Groups
Here are the individuals who work as part of one of the Analytics Section groups.

<% section = Gitlab::Homepage::Section.all!.find{|section| section.key == section_id} %>
<% section.stage_list.each do |stage| %>
   <% stage.group_list.each do |group| %>
<%="#### #{group.name}" %>
<%= partial('includes/product/group_table', locals: {group: group} ) %>
   <% end %>
<% end %>

## Section structure
The section is covered by groups from teams across two primary departments, Engineering and Product. Teams and team members from those departments have their own handbook pages linked below.

* Engineering
   * [Development](/handbook/engineering/development/)
      * [Product Intelligence](/handbook/engineering/development/analytics/product-intelligence/)
      * Product Analytics
   * [UX](/handbook/product/ux/#team-structure)
   * [Quality](/handbook/engineering/quality/#quality-engineering-structure)
* Product
   * TBD

## Investment Allocation
The [product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) within the Analytics Section are outlined in the [product categories page](/handbook/product/categories/#analytics-section).

The product department determines our [investment](https://internal-handbook.gitlab.io/handbook/product/investment/) within the section by allocating headcount for development team members to product groups. While doing so we adhere to the following principles:
* All product groups will maintain at least a 1:1:1 ratio between three primary DRIs - Product Managers, Product Designers and Engineering Managers.
* We don't currently maintain 1:1:1:1 ratio for the additional Software Engineer in Test (SET) DRI but desire to have singular stable-counterparts between SETs and product groups.
* We will strive to maintain at least 6 developers (FE + BE) in each product group

#### 5x5s
In order to satisfy intent `#1` - we'll start the meeting series by doing a weekly rotation of 5x5s - five minute presentations on five slides introducing yourself to the rest of the team.

### Analytics Section Retrospective
TBD

#### Intent
The intent of the Section Retrospective Summary meetings is to:
1. Share reflections, lessons learned and best practices across stages and groups
1. Serve as a communal forum to solve broad in scope problems or persistent blockers 
1. Share and celebrate accomplishments to give visibility into what other stages and groups are working on

#### Expectations
It's expected that engineering managers, engineers, and product managers contribute to the document sharing their stage reflections, lessons learned, and best practices in how their teams operate and how they perform retrospectives. Sharing these reflections, lessons learned, and best practices in the form of group handbook page content is preferred.

#### Moderators
Each Section Retrospective is led by a team member from the group. Any Analytics team members can volunteer as moderator by adding their name to the table below:

| Milestone | Moderator | Issue link |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 15.2  |  |  |
| 15.3  |  |  |
| 15.4  |  |  |
| 15.5  |  |  |
