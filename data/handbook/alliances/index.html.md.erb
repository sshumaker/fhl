# **Alliance Partner Program**


We are firm believers that partnership is the foundation from which collaboration and innovation is built upon. As a GitLab Alliance Partner, you’ll have access to the resources, tools, and support you need to accelerate business growth providing greater customer value through solution offerings that are integrated and interoperable with GitLab.

We recognize that not all partners have the same needs or goals, and as such, our program is designed with three Alliance Partner types in mind.


| **Cloud Partners** | **Platform Partners** | **Technology Partners** |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Partners that provide public cloud computing services and software marketplaces where customers can procure and deploy GitLab | Partners that provide modern cloud / cloud-native application platforms which increase the modularity and extensibility of GitLab across enterprises and architectures | Independent Software Vendors (ISV) Partners with complementary technologies that seamlessly integrate / interoperate with GitLab for more complete customer solutions |



#### **Pillars for Successful Partnerships**

Mutually beneficial value exchange drives mutual partner success. We believe these pillars ensure a more sustainable future.

- **Exposure** - Partnerships that generate exposure to new markets, segments, and users.
- **Product Knowledge** - Partnerships that have product familiarity provide greater advocacy.
- **Adoption** - Partnerships, both upstream and downstream, that increase feature adoption and product/platform utilization.
- **Revenue** - Partnerships that have a material effect on revenue growth.
- **Results** - Partnerships that align on objectives and outcomes.
- **Collaboration** - Partnerships that are committed to building reciprocal relationships between organizations and teams.



#### **Engagement Models**

There are a variety of ways to partner together to develop solutions. Partner type, solution and/or services offering, and route to market are all considerations when determining the best option, resale or co-sell.  Below are a few examples of how GitLab works with Alliance Partners to deliver consumable customer solutions.

- **Marketplace** (resale)
Solution listings sold through partner software marketplaces and other digital storefronts
- **OEM/Embedded** (resale)
Integrated or bundled solution offerings sold through direct and indirect channels
- **ISV** (co-sell)
Collaborative selling motions that stimulate sales of our respective products, independently
