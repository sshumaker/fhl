title: "Acquisition Process: Technical Due Diligence"
---

The technical diligence is part of our [acquisition process](/handbook/acquisitions/acquisition-process/).

1. Code and architecture diligence - your team will provide access for key engineering contacts at GitLab to code repositories, products, and development/test environments. The early technical diligence conducted before the term sheet is signed will be an abbreviated form of the diligence noted below. We will:
    - Perform a code review
    - Analyze the technology stack and how it fits in the GitLab tech stack.  Evaluate efforts and approaches for integration including milestones.
    - Conduct a [license review](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#quick-start) analyzing the licenses of the repositories owned by the target as well as of any open source packages which are in use to see which ones are acceptable per [company policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/open-source/#acceptable-licenses)
    - Conduct a [security review](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#quick-start).  Analyze what security vulnerabilities are known to exist in the product(s) and the process for determining this (static/dynamic security scanning, independent penetration testing, etc.).
    - Provide the results of any third-party security testing results.
    - Analyze any commercial software/services that are required for the product(s) to operate.
    - Evaluate development practices and standards
    - Analyze test suite coverage, framework, and automation
1. Employee evaluations - each engineer will undergo two rounds of interviews comprised of:
    - Technical assessment - a live coding session, solving a technical exercise or review a merge request with live followup session.
    - Manager interview
    - Evaluate potential team structure post-acquisition
1. In case of acquisitions with over 10 engineers the employee evaluation stage will happen in phased approach for 5 employees at a time.
1. In case where there aren't sufficient open recs matching the acquired team, the acquisition team can put a request to the executive team to approve new recs required.
