## Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)

GitLab’s Security Incident Response Team is the first line of defense for the GitLab SaaS and GitLab as an organization. The primary goal of SIRT is to minimize and control damage from security incidents. This is accomplished through the development and deployment of detection tools to identify when a security incident has occurred, taking action to identify and contain the event to limit its scope and impact, remediating the underlying issue that led to the security event, and recovering from the security event so that operations can return to normal. In addition to responding to incidents, the SIRT works to proactively prevent security incidents through the management and deployment of cyber defense tools, ensuring compliance with security best practices for our infrastructure and team members, and maintenance and training around the incident response process.

**Schedule / Topics Covered:**
- SIRT101.1: Intro to Incident Response
- SIRT101.2: Log investigation
- SIRT101.3: Detection, triage, remediation
- SIRT101.4: Hands-on SIRT Team Exercise

**Course Length:**
4 days, 8 hours

## Trust and Safety
Have you ever debated why something is right or  wrong, questioned a rule and wondered how to get around it? 
Do you prefer the uneasiness of ambiguity over the monotony of always knowing what to do?
If you answered yes to the above, [Trust and Safety](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/trustandsafety/) might be the place you discover what happens behind the curtains… or not, who knows?

The Trust and Safety teams' purpose is to try and ensure that users of GitLab.com operate within the scope of the [GitLab Website Terms of Use](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/#gitlab-com), more specifically, our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). As the name implies, the AUP is a policy that governs what the business has deemed to be the acceptable use of GitLab.com.
The AUP mainly consists of 3 parts:
- Compliance: Ensuring that we are enforcing the relevant laws and regulations that are applicable to GitLab.com.
    - These are non-negtiables and include things like complying with the [DMCA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/dmca/) and removing illegal content.
- Principles: Ensuring that GitLab.com is not used in a way that negatively impacts others.
    - This is primarily based on our [Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) and include things like removing content that is concidered harmful and protecting others privacy.
- Goal: Ensuring that GitLab.com is not used in a way that would negatively impact our [Vision](https://about.gitlab.com/company/vision/#vision). 
    - This is primarily used to ensure that GitLab.com is used for it's intented purpose, and to reduce any negatvie impact caused by an unintended and/or unforseen use of it.

If you think this is something you would be interested in learning about, maybe even do one day, come join us for a crash course in understanding the world of the Trust and Safety team!

**Schedule / Topics Covered:**
- TS101.1: What we do and why - Introduction 
- TS101.2: How we do it - Tooling and Workflows 
- TS101.3: Hands-on Experience

**Course Length:**
3 days, 6 hours

## Red Team
GitLab's internal red team extends the objectives of penetration testing by examining the security posture of the organization and their ability to implement effective cyber defenses. Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills).

Red team exercises provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world conditions over penetration testing. The exercises can further be used to improve security awareness and training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness. GitLab utilizes NIST 800-53 Revision 4 security control CA-8 to define the Red Team and their mission. The control can be found on [NIST.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CA-8).

The Red Team operates under a predefined set of [rules of engagement](/handbook/security/threat-management/red-team/red-team-roe.html). The rules of engagement exist to inform GitLab's team members on how the team operates during engagements. It provides guidelines for determining scope, the ethics we employ during our engagements, how we collaborate as a security team, and how we escalate vulnerabilities and exploits we discover during those engagements

**Schedule / Topics Covered:**
- RED101.1: GitLab’s Red Team Approach / Past exercise overview
- RED101.2: Red Team Threat Modeling
- RED101.3: Secret Scanning
- RED101.4: Hands On Red Team Exercise

**Course Length:**
4 days, 8 hours
