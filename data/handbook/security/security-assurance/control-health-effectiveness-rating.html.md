## Purpose

Control Health and Effectiveness Ratings (CHER) determine a [GitLab Security Controls](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/sec-controls.html) overall control health and effectiveness. 

## Scope

Observation risk ratings play a key role in determining how to establish a controls CHER. The procedures outlined in the sections below are used specifically by the Security Assurance Team once an observation's [risk rating is determined](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure.html). Team members utilizing the CHER for rating information system risks outside of control testing activities will not need to engage in the procedures below.

<summary><b>Determining the Individual Control Health & Effectiveness Rating (CHER)</b>

#### Risk rating and determining effectiveness

The importance of risk rating each control observation comes into play when making a final determination on how to establish a control's Control Health & Effectiveness Rating (CHER). CHER ratings on a sliding scale outside of the typical effective/ineffective rating used for compliance, allow for clearer communication and prioritization with broader audiences outside of compliance functions and allows non-compliance stakeholders the ability to view how observations impact the control environment.

CHER provides a qualitative value of a control's effectiveness that is used as an input for various processes within the Risk Management Program. When needing to report to management, these quantitative values are translated to qualitative terms: Fully Effective, Substantially Effective, Partially Effective, Largely Ineffective, Ineffective. Refer to the CHER Quantitative vs. Qualitative Terms and Definitions Table below for a mapping of CHER to its definition and the related qualitative term and definition. Use the rating determined by completing the observation risk rating with likelihood and impact scores and applying that risk rating into the table below (i.e if a control has 1 low risk observation per the Observation Risk Rating table, the CHER for that control would be a 2 (Substantially Effective)).

<summary><b>Determining System Health Rating</b>

#### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Terms and Definitions

CHER is assigned on a control by control basis but in instances where we want to report on system health, the ratio of high risk observations to the number of applicable controls that were assessed against the system is determined. That ratio is used to determine the system health rating from the following table:

Refer to the System Effectiveness Rating Table below for a mapping of averaged CHERs to the qualitative term and definition that can be used to report on system health/effectiveness. Note that when using this table the final average of CHER values should be rounded **up** to the nearest quantitative value to determine the CHER for the system (i.e if average of all CHER's equals 2.3, the final CHER for the system would be rounded up to a 3)

<summary><b>Determining Control Family Effectiveness Rating</b>

#### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Terms and Definitions

CHER is assigned on a control by control basis but in instances where we want to report on control family effectiveness, the CHER for each of the individual underlying controls in a control family can be averaged to provide a more holistic view. Refer to the Control Family Effectiveness Rating Table below for a mapping of averaged CHERs to the qualitative term and definition that can be used to report on control family health/effectiveness. Note that when using this table the final average of CHER values should be rounded **up** to the nearest quantitative value to determine the CHER for the control family (i.e if average of all CHER's equals 2.3, the final CHER for the control family would be rounded up to a 3).

#### CHER Override

To account for edge case scenarios or other extenuating circumstances that may not be modeled appropriately using the outlined GitLab Observation Management methodology, the final CHER can be downgraded (i.e move from 3 to 2) at the discretion of the Security Compliance Director if it is determined that the observation's risk rating and therefore CHER does not appropriately reflect the current control or control environment health. The rating cannot be upgraded (i.e move from 3 to 4) to ensure a conservative approach to securing the organization and managing risk.


## Exceptions

The process of completing control assessments will always require an associated CHER rating. There are no exceptions to this process.
