## Purpose
GitLab maintains a practiced incident response capability that trains all users on how to recognize and report suspicious security or privacy-related incidents so that trained incident responders can take the appropriate steps to handle incidents, in accordance with an Incident Response Plan (IRP).

## Scope
This control applies to all systems within our production environment. The production environment includes all endpoints and cloud assets used in hosting GitLab.com and its subdomains. This may include third-party systems that support the business of GitLab.com.

## Ownership

* Control Owner = Infrastructure
* Process Owner = Security Operations
