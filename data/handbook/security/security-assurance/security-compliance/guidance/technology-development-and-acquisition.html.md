## Ownership
This control is owned by Business Operations and Security Operations.

## Controls

| Control Number | Control Title | Control Statement | Goal | TOD | TOE | 
|:---------|:-------------|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| TDA-01 | Technology Development & Acquisition | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms for tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs. | Does the organization facilitate the implementation of tailored development and acquisition strategies, contract tools and procurement methods to meet unique business needs? | 1. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated mechanisms used to support development and acquisition strategies to meet business needs. | 1. Examine development, contract and procurement tools and methods including control activities and training for evidence that these tools and methods support the technological development of the business. | 
| TDA-02 | Security Requirements | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to include technical and functional specifications, explicitly or by reference, in system acquisitions based on an assessment of risk. | Does the organization include technical and functional specifications, explicitly or by reference, in system acquisitions based on an assessment of risk? | 1. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated with technical requirements and functional specifications of system acquisitions based on risk assessment. | 1. Examine the full population of risk assessments during the examination period. <br> <br> 2. Based on the risk assessment, examine technical requirements and functional specifications of the integration or acquisition of the system for evidence that specifications were followed according to the risk assessment. | 
| TDA-15 | Developer Threat Analysis & Flaw Remediation | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to require system developers and integrators to create a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan and implement the plan under the witness of an independent party. | Does the organization require system developers and integrators to create a Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan and implement the plan under the witness of an independent party? | 1. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated with the Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) plan and implementation. | 1. Examine ST&E(s) completed and implemented during the examination period. <br> <br> 2. Evaluate the ST&E for implementation, assessment, communication and remediation under the witness of an independent party. |

* *Test of Design* - (TOD) – verifies that a control is designed appropriately and that it will prevent or detect a particular risk.
* *Test of Operating Effectiveness* - (TOE) - used for verifying that the control is in place and it operates as it was designed.
