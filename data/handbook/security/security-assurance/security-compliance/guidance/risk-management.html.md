## Purpose
GitLab governs a risk management program and ensures that security and privacy-related risks are visible to and understood by the business unit(s) that own the assets and / or processes involved and are consistently identified, assessed, categorized and appropriately remediated. The security and privacy teams only advise and educate on risk management matters, while it is the business units and other key stakeholders who ultimately own the risk.

## Scope
This control is applicable to the GitLab organization as a whole.

## Ownership
This control is owned by the Risk and Field Security Team.

| RSK-04 | Risk Assessment | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to conduct an annual assessment of risk and to maintain a risk register that monitors the reporting of risks that includes the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of the organization's systems and data. | Does the organization conduct an annual assessment of risk that includes the likelihood and magnitude of harm, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of the organization's systems and data? | 1. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated with the documentation and reporting of the annual risk assessment and risk register. <br> <br> 2. Validate that the risk assessment and risk register were maintained and monitored. <br> <br> 3. Examine the risk register and risk assessment for evidence that, at a minimum, considerations for the organizations systems and data included: Likelihood and magnitude of harm Unauthorized access Use Disclosure Disruption Modification destruction. | 1. Examine the risk register and risk assessment to confirm an annual assessment occurred during the examination period. <br> <br> 2. Examine the risk register for evidence that the risk register was maintained and considerations outlined in the ToD were considered for each entity level risk identified. | 
| RSK-05 | Risk Ranking | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to identify and assign a risk ranking to newly discovered security vulnerabilities that is based on industry-recognized practices. | Does the organization identify and assign a risk ranking to newly discovered security vulnerabilities that is based on industry-recognized practices? | 1. Identify which industry-recognized practice(s) are used for risk ranking. <br> <br> 2. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated with the risk register that outline the assignment of the risk ranking. | 1. Examine the annual risk assessment and risk register for evidence that each risk has an assigned risk ranking based on industry-recognized practices. | 
| RSK-06 | Risk Remediation | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to remediate risks to an acceptable level and respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, incidents and audits to ensure proper remediation has been performed. | Does the organization remediate risks to an acceptable level? | 1. Examine the policies, procedures and related documents associated with the mechanisms to remediate risks and ensure proper remediation has been performed. | 1. Examine the full risk register and risk assessment for evidence that identified risks have remediation plans in place and/or have been performed. <br> <br> 2. Examine the full risk register and risk assessment for evidence that risks identified include findings from security and privacy assessments, incidents and that audits have been conducted after risk remediation to ensure remediation has been performed. | 
| RSK-07 | Risk Assessment Update | GitLab Inc. has implemented mechanisms to routinely update risk assessments and react accordingly upon identifying new security vulnerabilities, including using outside sources for security vulnerability information. | Does the organization routinely update risk assessments and react accordingly upon identifying new security vulnerabilities, including using outside sources for security vulnerability information? | 1.
