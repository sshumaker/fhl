## Purpose
GitLab ensures that technology assets are properly classified, by publishing and enforcing a data classification methodology to objectively determine the sensitivity and criticality of all data, dictating the minimum safeguards that must be in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data so that proper handling and disposal requirements can be followed.

## Scope

This control applies to all systems that handle, manage, store or transmit GitLab data including any end user devices that store such data.  This may include third-party systems that support the business of GitLab.com.

## Ownership
This control is owned by IT Ops.
