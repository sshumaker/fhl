## RFP Process

The Field Security Team, Legal & Corporate Affairs, Field Ops and Sales have created a process to assist and simplify the RFP process for the Field Team. With regards to RFP's, the Field Team should follow the below steps:

1. Upon receipt of an RFP, the Sales Team Member should ensure that an Account and Opportunity are created in SFDC;
1. If the RFP will require more than a quote being created (e.g. insight and assistance from various stakeholders), the Sales Team Member should request and receive ASM (or higher) approval via Chatter in the SFDC Opportunity. 
1. The Sales Team Member will review content in [AnswerBase](https://app.vendorpedia.com/vendor-portal/libraries) for any questions related to Security, Legal and ESG. _NOTE:_ All Team Members have a base-line entitlement.
1. Sales Team Member should engage [Deal Desk](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/sales-operations/deal-desk/#communicating-with-the-deal-desk-team), per standard process, for any question related to pricing and/or quoting. 
1. For questions related to Product, Marketing, Legal and/or ESG which were not answered following the steps above, the Sales Team Member can open an Issue [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues) and **SELECT THE RFP Intake Issue Template**,
1. RFP Intake Issues will be assigned to applicable DRIs and AnswerBase will be updated accordingly. 


## What Field Security Can't Do

There are parts of the RFP process that fall outside of Field Security's scope. _We cannot write the proposals or provide the following: product or service specifications, implementation schedule, and plans; training or support specifications and terms; information surrounding GitLab's ability to provide the appropriate resources; other GitLab customers' experiences; and anything related to costs, values, pricing, payments, etc._

What _we can do_ is respond to requests relating to security and facilitate other SME's responses to areas such as People/HR, Finance, Privacy, Commercial Legal, etc. 


## Helpful resources

While our team will do our very best to facilitate the process, there are some self-service resources to help you complete certain documents. 

If you receive a `Vendor Set Up Form`, you can find more information [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-process-customer-requested-vendor-setup-forms).

If you need an `NDA`, you can find more information on obtaining one [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/).
