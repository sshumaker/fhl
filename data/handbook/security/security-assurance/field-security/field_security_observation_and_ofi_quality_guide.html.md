## Purpose

This guide is designed to establish the quality expectations for observatiions and OFIs identified and documented by Field Security.

## Scope

This quality guide covers observations and OFIs identified by Field Security through customer [assurance activities](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/field-security/customer-security-assessment-process.html) in accordance with GitLab's [observation management program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure.html).

## Quality expectations

Field Security observations and OFIs should have the following characteristics:

- Contain enough detail for any team member to gain a fundamental understanding of what is being reported
    - What was identified?
    - Who was the prospect, customer, competitor, etc. that lead to the identification?
    - When was this identified?
    - How does this currently impact GitLab, or how could this impact GitLab in the future?
        - Why is this important, and why should we allocate resources towards it?
    - What can we do to remediate the problem, improve the solution, or position ourselves to take advantage of the identified situation?
- Be assigned to the appropriate team member for triage
- Have a proposed due date
    - This can be based on a clear deadline (e.g. the date a new regulation goes into effect), or it can be an estimate based on the perceived level of effort required to implement a solution.
- Be material in nature. For example, these identifications may:
    - Result in a financial impact for GitLab
    - Be the result of a new or updated compliance obligation for GitLab
    - Result in a competitive advantage for GitLab
    - Help us better support customer requests and expectations


**Note** Field Security observations and OFIs should be created in accordance with [observation creation procedure](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure.html).
