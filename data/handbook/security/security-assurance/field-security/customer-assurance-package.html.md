<div class="flex-row" markdown="0" style="height:80px">
    <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/" class="btn btn-purple-inv" style="width:100%;height:100%;margin:1px;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">GitLab Customer Assurance Package (Click Here!)</a>
</div> 

## GitLab offers and actively maintains two Customer Assurance Packages:

* Community Package: The first step on the trust journey, this package is a compilation of publicly available documentation designed to introduce GitLabâ€™s approach to security.
* Customer Package: This package provides detailed security information to prospective and existing customers for completing vendor security assessments.

## CAP request process

Due to the nature of some of GitLab's security reports, the [Customer Package](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/) is available under a [Non Disclosure Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/) or contractual confidentiality  clauses only.

**Note**: Customers who have registered for services via GitLab.com and paid via credit card will be required to sign a purpose specific [NDA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/NDA/) before the CAP can be distributed.

These resources can be requested by a GitLab team member on behalf of a customer/prospect using the **Customer Assurance workflow** in the [#sec-fieldsecurity](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/CV5A53V70) slack channel or opening an issue directly in the [Customer Assurance Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/field-security-team/customer-assurance-activities/caa-servicedesk). 

Customers or prospects can request a copy using the `Request by Email` option on our [Customer Assurance Package](https://about.gitlab.com/security/cap/) webpage.

#### SME owned collateral

For collateral owned by SMEs outside of Field Security, we perform an annual review and maintenance session. SMEs are notified via a GitLab issue and assigned relevant collateral pieces for review and maintenance. Upon completion, the updated collateral pieces are added to the appropriate CAP and prepared for publishing.
