## <i class="fas fa-bullseye" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Security Governance Mission

The 'G' in [GRC](https://www.oceg.org/about/what-is-grc/), GitLab's security governance discipline helps to define, train and measure security strategies and progress toward security objectives by creating a set of processes and practices that run across departments and functions. By following a Governance framework, GitLab ensures accountability, fairness and transparency in both how the company runs and how it communicates with its stakeholders. 

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb" style="color:rgb(110,73,203)" aria-hidden="true"></i> Core Competencies

These are the core responsibilities of the security governance discipline.

### Security policies and standards

Keeping the organization on track and within established boundaries to ensure compliance with laws and regulations while maintaining GitLab's [Information Security Policies](/handbook/security/#information-security-policies). Providing guidance, consistency and accountability to streamline internal processes and align with GitLab's values and mission.

#### Security handbook maintenance

Security Governance is responsible for the continuous maintenance and improvement of the `security` section in GitLab's handbook. This includes the creation and maintenance of [security policies and standards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-assurance/governance/#security-policies-and-standards), the creation and maintenance of [controlled documents](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/controlled-document-program.html), maintenance of the `security` section's overall structure, content relevance and accuracy, and alignment with GitLab's [style guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/style-guide/).

### Security Assurance metrics

Measuring performance effectiveness of our security controls, against a plan to prevent security incidents and safeguard sensitive data to improve the security posture of GitLab and the reduction of risk. "If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it" -Lord Kevin.

### Regulatory and compliance landscape monitoring

To support GitLab's regulatory and compliance requirements, the Security Governance team conducts **quarterly** monitoring for changes to such requirements. Material changes are reported to relevant team members for triage and action.

### GCF Control Maintenance

Managing the [GCF control framework](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/sec-controls.html), to include changes as a result of the risks and regulatory requirements. 

### Security Compliance Training

Creating and managing [security compliance trainings](/handbook/security/security-assurance/governance/sec-training.html) to ensure GitLab team members are aware and trained in security core competencies.

### GRC Application Administration

Managing a [variety of tools](/handbook/security/security-assurance/#core-tools-and-systems-1) used by the Security Assurance Team carrying out defined administrative tasks such as 
* Configuration changes
* User Access Management
* Upgrades/patching/incidents/restores
* High-Level quality oversight
* etc.

We will assist in managing and providing guidance to carry out day to day activities related to the core competencies of all [compliance activities within ZenGRC](/handbook/security/security-assurance/zg-activities.html) such as Control Testing, UARs, Vendor Reviews and Risk Assessments to automate, integrate and streamline business processes to increase GitLab's Information Security Program maturity and deliver measurable ROI.
