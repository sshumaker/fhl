## Purpose

The Controlled Documents Annual Review Work Instruction focuses on the annual review of Controlled Documents to ensure they are meeting [procedural expectations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/controlled-document-procedure.html). The Controlled Document Procedure is in place to ensure that there is consistency in developing and maintaining controlled documents at GitLab according to legal and regulatory requirements.


## Scope

1. Controlled Documents: Formal policies, standards and procedures.

Goal: 100% of controlled documents reviewed and approved annually.

## Roles & Responsibilities:

| Role  | Responsibility |
|-----------|-----------|
| Security Governance Team | Responsible for maintaining the work instructions and facilitating annual controlled documents review |
| Security Compliance Team | Responsible for testing Security Policies and supporting standards and procedures as part of ongoing continuous control monitoring |
| Security Assurance Management (Code Owners) | Responsible for approving changes to these work instructions |
| Code Owners | Responsible for defining, implementing and maintaining controlled documents for their programs |
| Everyone |  Everyone is welcomed and encouraged to create or suggest changes to controlled documents at any time.

## Procedure

### Annual Review
Controlled documents are required to be reviewed and approved on a minimum of an annual basis and may be updated ad hoc as required by business operations.

The Security Governance team will initiate and track the annual review via a GitLab Epic. Issues will be opened for each department and assigned to the relevant Code Owners with a list of in scope documents and instructions. Merge Requests will be opened in cases where changes are required and tracked via the same issue.

#### Annual Review Epics
- [FY23 Controlled Document Review](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/governance/-/epics/7)

### SSOT Maintenance
When a new controlled document is identified, an MR should be opened and assigned to Security Governance to add the document to the [List of Controlled Documents](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/controlled-document-program.html#list-of-controlled-documents).

The [Controlled Documents Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/governance/security-governance/-/blob/master/runbooks/controlled%20documents%20template.md) should be applied at this time if not already done.

## Exceptions
Exceptions to this program will be tracked as per the [Information Security Policy Exception Management Process](/handbook/security/#information-security-policy-exception-management-process).
