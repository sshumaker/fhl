## Security OKRs
The Security organization executes quarterly [Objectives and Key Results or OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

### How We Plan, Assign, and Execute Work

Four Mondays before the start of the fiscal quarter, in the days after the CEO shares OKRs with all of GitLab in the #okr channel, the CISO proposes OKRs for the Security department in the OKR draft review meeting agenda for a maximum of 3 objectives. Security leaders are to propose draft OKRs to the CISO prior to the meeting for inclusion. 

From FY24 Q1 forward all Security OKRs are documented in the [GitLab OKR project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs). For easy filtering, all Security Objective and KR issues have [Label = Department::Security](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gitlab-OKRs/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Department%3A%3ASecurity&first_page_size=100) applied.

Larger initiatives that span the scope of multiple teams or projects may require a [Working Group](https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/structure/working-groups/).
